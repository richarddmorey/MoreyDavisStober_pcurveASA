Correlation analysis, regression analysis, and model reduction are used to attempt to determine which aspects of time management the students practiced, which time management behaviors were more strongly associated with higher grades within the program, and whether or not those students who self-identified with specific time management behaviors achieved better grades in the program. It was found that students? perceived control of time was the factor that correlated significantly with cumulative grade point average. On average, it was found that time management behaviors were not significantly different across gender, age, entry qualification, and time already spent in the program.},

  abstract = {Publication bias is a substantial problem for the credibility of research in general and of meta-analyses in particular, as it yields overestimated effects and may suggest the existence of non-existing effects. Although there is consensus that publication bias exists, how strongly it affects different scientific literatures is currently less well-known. We examined evidence of publication bias in a large-scale data set of primary studies that were included in 83 meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin (representing meta-analyses from psychology) and 499 systematic reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR; representing meta-analyses from medicine). Publication bias was assessed on all homogeneous subsets (3.8\% of all subsets of meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin) of primary studies included in meta-analyses, because publication bias methods do not have good statistical properties if the true effect size is heterogeneous. Publication bias tests did not reveal evidence for bias in the homogeneous subsets. Overestimation was minimal but statistically significant, providing evidence of publication bias that appeared to be similar in both fields. However, a Monte-Carlo simulation study revealed that the creation of homogeneous subsets resulted in challenging conditions for publication bias methods since the number of effect sizes in a subset was rather small (median number of effect sizes equaled 6). Our findings are in line with, in its most extreme case, publication bias ranging from no bias until only 5\% statistically nonsignificant effect sizes being published. These and other findings, in combination with the small percentages of statistically significant primary effect sizes (28.9\% and 18.9\% for subsets published in Psychological Bulletin and CDSR), led to the conclusion that evidence for publication bias in the studied homogeneous subsets is weak, but suggestive of mild publication bias in both psychology and medicine.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the performance of the FAT-PET-PEESE (FPP) procedure, a commonly employed approach for addressing publication bias in the economics and business meta-analysis literature. The FPP procedure is generally used for 3 purposes: (1) to test whether a sample of estimates suffers from publication bias, (2) to test whether the estimates indicate that the effect of interest is statistically different from zero, and (3) to obtain an estimate of the mean true effect. Our findings indicate that the FPP procedure performs well in the basic but unrealistic environment of fixed effects, where all estimates are assumed to derive from a single population value and sampling error is the only reason for why studies produce different estimates. However, when we study its performance in more realistic data environments, where there is heterogeneity in the population effects across and within studies, the FPP procedure becomes unreliable for the first 2 purposes and is less efficient than other estimators when estimating overall mean effect. Further, hypothesis tests about the mean true effect are frequently unreliable. We corroborate our findings by recreating the simulation framework of Stanley and Doucouliagos (2017) and repeat our tests using their framework.},

The mean percentage of actual kilocalories greater than the labeled kilocalories (mean percentage over label) per item was 85.42\% (SD=77.88\%; P=.01). Regionally distributed foods had significantly more kilocalories than were reported (P=.001 for kilocalories per item, P=.02 for kilocalories per gram) and mean percentage over label per item was 25.22\% (SD=15.58\%) and per gram was 14.97\% (SD=17.95\%).

Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a ``replication crisis'' may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

  abstract = {Detection and avoidance of sick individuals have been proposed as essential components in a behavioural defence against disease, limiting the risk of contamination. However, almost no knowledge exists on whether humans can detect sick individuals, and if so by what cues. Here, we demonstrate that untrained people can identify sick individuals above chance level by looking at facial photos taken 2 h after injection with a bacterial stimulus inducing an immune response (2.0 ng kg-1 lipopolysaccharide) or placebo, the global sensitivity index being d{$\prime$} = 0.405. Signal detection analysis (receiver operating characteristic curve area) showed an area of 0.62 (95\% confidence intervals 0.60--0.63). Acutely sick people were rated by naive observers as having paler lips and skin, a more swollen face, droopier corners of the mouth, more hanging eyelids, redder eyes, and less glossy and patchy skin, as well as appearing more tired. Our findings suggest that facial cues associated with the skin, mouth and eyes can aid in the detection of acutely sick and potentially contagious people.},

  abstract = {The psychological and statistical literature contains several proposals for calculating and plotting confidence intervals (CIs) for within-subjects (repeated measures) ANOVA designs. A key distinction is between intervals supporting inference about patterns of means (and differences between pairs of means, in particular) and those supporting inferences about individual means. In this report, it is argued that CIs for the former are best accomplished by adapting intervals proposed by Cousineau (Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology, 1, 42--45, 2005) and Morey (Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology, 4, 61--64, 2008) so that nonoverlapping CIs for individual means correspond to a confidence for their difference that does not include zero. CIs for the latter can be accomplished by fitting a multilevel model. In situations in which both types of inference are of interest, the use of a two-tiered CI is recommended. Free, open-source, cross-platform software for such interval estimates and plots (and for some common alternatives) is provided in the form of R functions for one-way within-subjects and two-way mixed ANOVA designs. These functions provide an easy-to-use solution to the difficult problem of calculating and displaying within-subjects CIs.},

As the universities shifted from onsite learning to online learning, course satisfaction and student engagement became the emerging concern among teachers. This study was designed to determine the significant relationship between course satisfaction and student engagement in online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in the University of Mindanao -- Bansalan College, Philippines. A total of 529 university students responded to the online survey. Results showed students' high level of course satisfaction and engagement with online learning delivery. Students have the same level of satisfaction on online learning delivery quality but have different online learning engagement levels as to year level. Also, this study revealed that online course satisfaction was significantly correlated with online student engagement. Through structural equation modeling, it was further specified that online course satisfaction is significantly related to students' skills engagement, emotion engagement, participation engagement, and performance engagement as constructs of student engagement in online learning. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to improve online learning delivery quality in the new normal setting amid the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure to fill the gap between those students from advantaged and underprivileged backgrounds.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The well-documented association between fingers and numbers is not only based on the observation that most children use their fingers for counting and initial calculation, but also on extensive behavioral and neuro-functional evidence. In this article, we critically review developmental studies evaluating the association between finger sensorimotor skills (i.e., finger gnosis and fine motor skills) and numerical abilities. In sum, reviewed studies were found to provide evidential value and indicated that both finger gnosis {$<$}italic{$>$}and{$<$}/italic{$>$} fine motor skills predict measures of counting, number system knowledge, number magnitude processing, and calculation ability. Therefore, specific and unique contributions of both finger gnosis and fine motor skills to the development of numerical skills seem to be substantiated. Through critical consideration of the reviewed evidence, we suggest that the association of finger gnosis and fine motor skills with numerical abilities may emerge from a combination of functional and redeployment mechanisms, in which the early use of finger-based numerical strategies during childhood might be the developmental process by which number representations become intertwined with the finger sensorimotor system, which carries an innate predisposition for said association to unfold. Further research is nonetheless necessary to clarify the causal mechanisms underlying this association.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In Experiment 1, participants who were led to anticipate a lonely future life were less able to make themselves consume a healthy but bad-tasting beverage. In Experiment 2, some participants were told that no one else in their group wanted to work with them, and these participants later ate more cookies than other participants. In Experiment 3, excluded participants quit sooner on a frustrating task. In Experiments 4-6, exclusion led to impairment of attention regulation as measured with a dichotic listening task. Experiments 5 and 6 further showed that decrements in self-regulation can be eliminated by offering a cash incentive or increasing self-awareness. Thus, rejected people are capable of self-regulation but are normally disinclined to make the effort. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of testing for partial conjunction of hypothesis, which argues that at least u out of n tested hypotheses are false. It offers an in-between approach to the testing of the conjunction of null hypotheses against the alternative that at least one is not, and the testing of the disjunction of null hypotheses against the alternative that all hypotheses are not null. We suggest powerful test statistics for testing such a partial conjunction hypothesis that are valid under dependence between the test statistics as well as under independence. We then address the problem of testing many partial conjunction hypotheses simultaneously using the false discovery rate (FDR) approach. We prove that if the FDR controlling procedure in Benjamini and Hochberg (1995, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 57, 289-300) is used for this purpose the FDR is controlled under various dependency structures. Moreover, we can screen at all levels simultaneously in order to display the findings on a superimposed map and still control an appropriate FDR measure. We apply the method to examples from microarray analysis and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), two application areas where the need for partial conjunction analysis has been identified.},

This simple method has some optimal properties including attaining exactly a prespecified consumer's risk and uniformly minimizing the producer's risk. These results are obtained from more general hypothesis-testing results concerning null hypotheses consisting of the unions of sets.},

  abstract = {Practicality was a valued attribute of academic psychological theory during its initial decades, but usefulness has since faded in importance to the field. Theories are now evaluated mainly on their ability to account for decontextualized laboratory data and not their ability to help solve societal problems. With laudable exceptions in the clinical, intergroup, and health domains, most psychological theories have little relevance to people's everyday lives, poor accessibility to policymakers, or even applicability to the work of other academics who are better positioned to translate the theories to the practical realm. We refer to the lack of relevance, accessibility, and applicability of psychological theory to the rest of society as the practicality crisis. The practicality crisis harms the field in its ability to attract the next generation of scholars and maintain viability at the national level. We describe practical theory and illustrate its use in the field of self-regulation. Psychological theory is historically and scientifically well positioned to become useful should scholars in the field decide to value practicality. We offer a set of incentives to encourage the return of social psychology to the Lewinian vision of a useful science that speaks to pressing social issues.},

  abstract = {1 Abstract Background The risk of relapse after antidepressant medication (ADM) discontinuation is high. Predictors of relapse could guide clinical decision-making, but are yet to be established. Method We assessed demographic and clinical variables in a longitudinal observational study before antidepressant discontinuation. State-dependent variables were re-assessed either after discontinuation or before discontinuation after a waiting period. Relapse was assessed during six months after discontinuation. We applied logistic general linear models in combination with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and elastic nets to avoid overfitting in order to identify predictors of relapse and estimated their generalisability using cross-validation. Results The final sample included 104 patients (age: 34.86 (11.1), 77\% female) and 57 healthy controls (age: 34.12 (10.6), 70\% female). 36\% of the patients experienced a relapse. Treatment by a general practitioner increased the risk of relapse. Although within-sample statistical analyses suggested reasonable sensitivity and specificity, out-of-sample prediction of relapse was at chance level. Residual symptoms increased with discontinuation, but did not relate to relapse. Conclusion and Relevance Demographic and standard clinical variables appear to carry little predictive power and therefore are of limited use for patients and clinicians in guiding clinical decision-making.},

Across 4 experiments, 3 patterns of data were observed: (1) evidence of stereotype priming under baseline conditions of intention and high cognitive constraints; (2) significant reduction of stereotype priming when a counterstereotype intention was formed even though cognitive constraints were high; and (3) complete reversal of stereotype priming when a counterstereotype intention was formed and cognitive constraints were low. These data support proposals that stereotypes may be automatically activated, as well as proposals that perceivers can control and even eliminate such effects.

The fully updated second edition includes new and expanded content on avoiding common mistakes in meta-analysis, understanding heterogeneity in effects, publication bias, and more. Several brand-new chapters provide a systematic "how to" approach to performing and reporting a meta-analysis from start to finish.Written by four of the world's foremost authorities on all aspects of meta-analysis, the new edition:Outlines the role of meta-analysis in the research processShows how to compute effects sizes and treatment effectsExplains the fixed-effect and random-effects models for synthesizing dataDemonstrates how to assess and interpret variation in effect size across studiesExplains how to avoid common mistakes in meta-analysisDiscusses controversies in meta-analysisIncludes access to a companion website containing videos, spreadsheets, data files, free software for prediction intervals, and step-by-step instructions for performing analyses using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA)Download videos, class materials, and worked examples at www.Introduction-to-Meta-Analysis.com"This book offers the reader a unified framework for thinking about meta-analysis, and then discusses all elements of the analysis within that framework. The authors address a series of common mistakes and explain how to avoid them. As the editor-in-chief of the American Psychologist and former editor of Psychological Bulletin, I can say without hesitation that the quality of manuscript submissions reporting meta-analyses would be vastly better if researchers read this book."{\texthorizontalbar}Harris Cooper, Hugo L. Blomquist Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Neuroscience, Editor-in-chief of the American Psychologist, former editor of Psychological Bulletin"A superb combination of lucid prose and informative graphics, the authors provide a refreshing departure from cookbook approaches with their clear explanations of the what and why of meta-analysis. The book is ideal as a course textbook or for self-study. My students raved about the clarity of the explanations and examples." {\texthorizontalbar}David Rindskopf, Distinguished Professor of Educational Psychology, City University of New York, Graduate School and University Center, \& Editor of the Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics"The approach taken by Introduction to Meta-analysis is intended to be primarily conceptual, and it is amazingly successful at achieving that goal. The reader can comfortably skip the formulas and still understand their application and underlying motivation. For the more statistically sophisticated reader, the relevant formulas and worked examples provide a superb practical guide to performing a meta-analysis. The book provides an eclectic mix of examples from education, social science, biomedical studies, and even ecology. For anyone considering leading a course in meta-analysis, or pursuing self-directed study, Introduction to Meta-analysis would be a clear first choice." {\texthorizontalbar}Jesse A. Berlin, ScD},

  abstract = {This article aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: theory construction methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

  abstract = {The call for greater openness in research data is quickly growing in many scientific fields. Psychology as a field, however, still falls short in this regard. Research is vulnerable to human error, inaccurate interpretation, and reporting of study results, and decisions during the research process being biased toward favorable results. Despite the obligation to share data for verification and the importance of this practice for protecting against human error, many psychologists do not fulfill their ethical responsibility of sharing their research data. This has implications for the accurate and ethical dissemination of specific research findings and the scientific development of the field more broadly. Open science practices provide promising approaches to address the ethical issues of inaccurate reporting and false-positive results in psychological research literature that hinder scientific growth and ultimately violate several relevant ethical principles and standards from the American Psychological Association's (APA's) Ethical Principles of Psychologists Code of Conduct (APA, 2017). Still, current incentive structures in the field for publishing and professional advancement appear to induce hesitancy in applying these practices. With each of these considerations in mind, recommendations on how psychologists can ethically proceed through open science practices and incentive restructuring---in particular, data management, data and code sharing, study preregistration, and registered reports---are provided.

  abstract = {One particular weakness of psychology that was left implicit by Meehl is the fact that psychological theories tend to be verbal theories, permitting at best ordinal predictions. Such predictions do not enable the high-risk tests that would strengthen our belief in the verisimilitude of theories but instead lead to the practice of null-hypothesis significance testing, a practice Meehl believed to be a major reason for the slow theoretical progress of soft psychology. The rising popularity of meta-analysis has led some to argue that we should move away from significance testing and focus on the size and stability of effects instead. Proponents of this reform assume that a greater emphasis on quantity can help psychology to develop a cumulative body of knowledge. The crucial question in this endeavor is whether the resulting numbers really have theoretical meaning. Psychological science lacks an undisputed, preexisting domain of observations analogous to the observations in the space-time continuum in physics. It is argued that, for this reason, effect sizes do not really exist independently of the adopted research design that led to their manifestation. Consequently, they can have no bearing on the verisimilitude of a theory.},

Proponents of mind-set theory have made bold claims about mind-set's importance. For example, one's mind-set is described as having profound effects on one's motivation and achievements, creating different psychological worlds for people, and forming the core of people's meaning systems. We examined the evidentiary strength of six key premises of mind-set theory in 438 participants; we reasoned that strongly worded claims should be supported by equally strong evidence. However, no support was found for most premises. All associations (rs) were significantly weaker than .20. Other achievement-motivation constructs, such as self-efficacy and need for achievement, have been found to correlate much more strongly with presumed associates of mind-set. The strongest association with mind-set (r = -.12) was opposite from the predicted direction. The results suggest that the foundations of mind-set theory are not firm and that bold claims about mind-set appear to be overstated.},

In fact, for many classes of prior distributions it is shown that the infimum of the Bayesian posterior probability of H 0 is equal to the p value; in other cases the infimum is less than the p value. The results are in contrast to recent work of Berger and Sellke (1987) in the two-sided (point null) case, where it was found that the p value is much smaller than the Bayesian infimum. Some comments on the point null problem are also given.},

  abstract = {Registered Reports are a form of empirical publication in which study proposals are peer reviewed and pre-accepted before research is undertaken. By deciding which articles are published based on the question, theory and methods, Registered Reports offer a remedy for a range of reporting and publication biases. Here, we reflect on the history, progress and future prospects of the Registered Reports initiative and offer practical guidance for authors, reviewers and editors. We review early evidence that Registered Reports are working as intended, while at the same time acknowledging that they are not a universal solution for irreproducibility. We also consider how the policies and practices surrounding Registered Reports are changing, or must change in the future, to address limitations and adapt to new challenges. We conclude that Registered Reports are promoting reproducibility, transparency and self-correction across disciplines and may help reshape how society evaluates research and researchers.},

Asymptotic and non-asymptotic optimality properties of combined tests are studied. The asymptotic study centers around two notions. The first is Bahadur efficiency. The second is based on a notion of second order comparisons. The non-asymptotic study is concerned with admissibility questions. Most of the popular combining methods are considered along with a method not studied in the past. Among the results are the following: Assume each of the p statistics has the same Bahadur slope. Then the combined test based on the sum of normal transforms, is asymptotically best among all tests studied, by virtue of second order considerations. Most of the popular combined tests are inadmissible for testing the noncentrality parameter of chi-square, t, and F distributions. For chi-square a combined test is offered which is admissible, asymptotically optimal (first order), asymptotically optimal (second order) among all tests studied, and for which critical values are obtainable in special cases. Extensions of the basic model are given.},

Results: Several terms that are regarded as cognates in English and Spanish elicited significantly different likelihood ratings. Several language equivalencies were also identified. Conclusions: These findings provide the first reported evaluation of Spanish likelihood terms for use in risk communications directed towards monolingual and bilingual Spanish speakers.},

  abstract = {Professional probabilists have long argued over what probability means, with, for example, Bayesians arguing that probabilities refer to subjective degrees of confidence and frequentists arguing that probabilities refer to the frequencies of events in the world. Recently, Gigerenzer and his colleagues have argued that these same distinctions are made by untutored subjects, and that, for many domains, the human mind represents probabilistic information as frequencies. We analyze several reasons why, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, certain classes of problem-solving mechanisms in the human mind should be expected to represent probabilistic information as frequencies. Then, using a problem famous in the ``heuristics and biases'' literature for eliciting base rate neglect, we show that correct Bayesian reasoning can be elicited in 76\% of subjects - indeed, 92\% in the most ecologically valid condition - simply by expressing the problem in frequentist terms. This result adds to the growing body of literature showing that frequentist representations cause various cognitive biases to disappear, including overconfidence, the conjunction fallacy, and base-rate neglect. Taken together, these new findings indicate that the conclusion most common in the literature on judgment under uncertainty - that our inductive reasoning mechanisms do not embody a calculus of probability - will have to be re-examined. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, humans may turn out to be good intuitive statisticians after all.},

One is that testosterone leads directly to antisocial behavior. The other is that a constellation of dominance, competitiveness, and sensation seeking associated with testosterone leads to either antisocial or prosocial behavior, depending upon an individual's resources and background. Analysis of archival data from 4,462 U.S. military veterans supported the first hypothesis: Testosterone was correlated with a variety of antisocial behaviors among all individuals. However, socioeconomic status (SES) proved to be a moderating variable, with weaker testosterone-behavior relationships among high SES subjects.},

  abstract = {Current attempts at methodological reform in sciences come in response to an overall lack of rigor in methodological and scientific practices in experimental sciences. However, some of these reform attempts suffer from the same mistakes and over-generalizations they purport to address. Considering the costs of allowing false claims to become canonized, we argue for more rigor and nuance in methodological reform. By way of example, we present a formal analysis of three common claims in the metascientific literature: (a) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (b) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (c) that exploratory projects are characterized by poor statistical practice. We show that none of these three claims are correct in general and we explore when they do and do not hold.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

  abstract = {The sense of agency (SoA) refers to perceived causality of the self, i.e. the feeling of causing something to happen. The SoA has been probed using a variety of explicit and implicit measures. Explicit measures include rating scales and questionnaires. Implicit measures, which include sensory attenuation and temporal binding, use perceptual differences between self- and externally generated stimuli as measures of the SoA. In the present study, we investigated whether the different measures tap into the same self-attribution processes by determining whether individual differences on implicit and explicit measures of SoA are correlated. Participants performed tasks in which they triggered tones via key presses (operant condition) or passively listened to tones triggered by a computer (observational condition). We replicated previously reported effects of sensory attenuation and temporal binding. Surprisingly the two implicit measures of SoA were not significantly correlated with each other, nor did they correlate with the explicit measures of SoA. Our results suggest that some explicit and implicit measures of the SoA may tap into different processes.},

  abstract = {The effect of availability of lecture recordings on academic outcomes is not clear and it is not known whether these recordings change the association between lecture attendance and academic outcomes. Few surveys of lecture attendance or lecture recordings use by students are linked to academic outcomes. The aims were (i) to determine any association between lecture attendance and academic outcomes for students who had access to lecture recordings, (ii) to determine any association between accessing lecture recordings and academic outcomes and (iii) to use a survey to determine why students attend lectures and/or access lecture recordings in a course in medical laboratory science. Consenting students signed in when attending lectures and/or completed an online survey. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to determine whether there was an association between attending lectures or accessing lecture recordings and academic outcomes. Consent rates were high for both the sign-in (90\%) and survey (64\%). The main findings were that in 2017 and 2018: (i) the average lecture attendance was 39 and 27\%, respectively, (ii) there was no association between lecture attendance and academic outcomes, (iii) there was no association between accessing lecture recordings and academic outcomes. Survey respondents were almost equally divided between those attending lectures weekly, sometimes or not. Reasons for attending lectures included greater perceived learning and interaction with staff and other students, while reasons for not attending related to inconvenience or other commitments. Lecture recordings were accessed to clarify, revise or catch up on content, or as an alternative to attending lectures. One-third of students provided additional feedback on accessing lecture recordings, and the most common themes were `flexibility' and `useful'. Lecture slides (PowerPoints), independently of lecture recordings, were used extensively by the students. From this study, it does not seem that either lecture attendance or accessing lecture recordings are major determinants of academic outcomes for most students. As students vary in their lecture attendance and use of online resources including lecture recordings and lecture slides, academic staff should continue to provide a range of resources for students.},

We here report the results from prediction markets set up to quantify the reproducibility of 44 studies published in prominent psychology journals and replicated in the Reproducibility Project: Psychology. The prediction markets predict the outcomes of the replications well and outperform a survey of market participants' individual forecasts. This shows that prediction markets are a promising tool for assessing the reproducibility of published scientific results. The prediction markets also allow us to estimate probabilities for the hypotheses being true at different testing stages, which provides valuable information regarding the temporal dynamics of scientific discovery. We find that the hypotheses being tested in psychology typically have low prior probabilities of being true (median, 9\%) and that a ``statistically significant'' finding needs to be confirmed in a well-powered replication to have a high probability of being true. We argue that prediction markets could be used to obtain speedy information about reproducibility at low cost and could potentially even be used to determine which studies to replicate to optimally allocate limited resources into replications.},

  abstract = {In this study, I examined the effects of offering supplemental video lecture recordings to students in a face-to-face introductory psychology course. I employed a quasi-experimental design, in which one section had lectures recordings available (recordings of the face-to-face lecture) and one section did not, and I examined whether class section affected achievement and whether attendance mediated this relationship. Although students had favorable views of the lecture capture technology and thought it should be available campus wide, few actually viewed the recordings, and those who did used them mainly as a substitute rather than a supplement to face-to-face lectures. More importantly, the class with lecture recordings available had significantly lower attendance rates and course achievement (final grades), and attendance mediated the relationship between class section and achievement. Further analyses showed that the negative effects of offering lecture recordings were not global; instead, lecture recording availability appeared to increase nonparticipation (in exams, class activities, and assignments) in a select group of students. When these nonparticipators were excluded from analyses, significant differences between class sections disappeared.},

  abstract = {Students' usage of lecture recordings can be characterised by usage frequency, repetitiveness and selectivity in watching, lecture attendance, and social context and location in which students watch the lecture recordings. At the University of M{\"u}nster (Germany), the lecture recording service was evaluated over three semesters. The data were combined and used for a cluster analysis with the aim of being able to describe the students' distinct usage patterns. The cluster analysis was performed using partitioning around medoids with Gower distance. Five clusters of students were identified, which differed mainly on the amount of lecture recordings watched, whether the lecture recordings were watched completely or partially, whether the recordings were watched once or multiple times, and the number of lectures the students missed. The five clusters are interpreted as representing different ways of utilising lecture recordings. The clustering provides a basis for investigating the usage of lecture recordings in the context of different approaches to learning and learning strategies.},

  abstract = {.Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons (2014a) proposed p-curve -- the distribution of statistically significant p-values for a set of studies -- as a tool to assess the evidential value of these studies. They argued that, whereas right-skewed p-curves indicate true underlying effects, left-skewed p-curves indicate selective reporting of significant results when there is no true effect (``p-hacking''). We first review previous research showing that, in contrast to the first claim, null effects may produce right-skewed p-curves under some conditions. We then question the second claim by showing that not only selective reporting but also selective nonreporting of significant results due to a significant outcome of a more popular alternative test of the same hypothesis may produce left-skewed p-curves, even if all studies reflect true effects. Hence, just as right-skewed p-curves do not necessarily imply evidential value, left-skewed p-curves do not necessarily imply p-hacking and absence of true effects in the studies involved.},

We believe that this assessment still holds, as also evidenced by increasingly common claims that psychology is facing a ``theory crisis'' and that psychologists should invest more in theory building. In this article, we argue that the root cause of the theory crisis is that developing good psychological theories is extremely difficult and that understanding the reasons why it is so difficult is crucial for moving forward in the theory crisis. We discuss three key reasons based on philosophy of science for why developing good psychological theories is so hard: the relative lack of robust phenomena that impose constraints on possible theories, problems of validity of psychological constructs, and obstacles to discovering causal relationships between psychological variables. We conclude with recommendations on how to move past the theory crisis.},

However, there is still much to be understood about lecture capture and the full impact on student learning, especially in different institutional and subject contexts. This article describes two projects from a UK Russell Group University that worked in partnership with students to gain insights into the student experience regarding lecture capture. The article highlights insights gained in terms of how and why students use lecture recordings. This article focuses on one area in particular which has been less reported and warrants further investigation -- students' use of lecture recordings in collaborative settings. The article considers some practical implications of such insights and argues that a nuanced understanding regarding the way students use lecture recordings for learning is required. The article also highlights how educationists can harness student partnerships to further our understanding of the complex interplays between technology and student learning.},

  abstract = {The current debate about how to improve the quality of psychological science revolves, almost exclusively, around the subordinate level of statistical significance testing. In contrast, research design and strict theorizing, which are superordinate to statistics in the methods hierarchy, are sorely neglected. The present article is devoted to the key role assigned to manipulation checks (MCs) for scientific quality control. MCs not only afford a critical test of the premises of hypothesis testing but also (a) prompt clever research design and validity control, (b) carry over to refined theorizing, and (c) have important implications for other facets of methodology, such as replication science. On the basis of an analysis of the reality of MCs reported in current issues of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, we propose a future methodology for the post--p {$<$} .05 era that replaces scrutiny in significance testing with refined validity control and diagnostic research designs.},

  abstract = {The concept of school engagement has attracted increasing attention as representing a possible antidote to declining academic motivation and achievement. Engagement is presumed to be malleable, responsive to contextual features, and amenable to environmental change. Researchers describe behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement and recommend studying engagement as a multifaceted construct. This article reviews definitions, measures, precursors, and outcomes of engagement; discusses limitations in the existing research; and suggests improvements. The authors conclude that, although much has been learned, the potential contribution of the concept of school engagement to research on student experience has yet to be realized. They call for richer characterizations of how students behave, feel, and think?research that could aid in the development of finely tuned interventions},

  abstract = {Null hypotheses are simple, precise, and theoretically important. Conventional statistical analysis cannot support them; Bayesian analysis can. The challenge in a Bayesian analysis is to formulate a suitably vague alternative, because the vaguer the alternative is (the more it spreads out the unit mass of prior probability), the more the null is favored. A general solution is a sensitivity analysis: Compute the odds for or against the null as a function of the limit(s) on the vagueness of the alternative. If the odds on the null approach 1 from above as the hypothesized maximum size of the possible effect approaches 0, then the data favor the null over any vaguer alternative to it. The simple computations and the intuitive graphic representation of the analysis are illustrated by the analysis of diverse examples from the current literature. They pose 3 common experimental questions: (a) Are 2 means the same? (b) Is performance at chance? (c) Are factors additive?},

  abstract = {Distance is important: From an ecological perspective, knowledge about the distance to either prey or predator is vital. However, the distance of an unknown sound source is particularly difficult to assess, especially in anechoic environments. In vision, changes in perspective resulting from observer motion produce a reliable, consistent, and unambiguous impression of depth known as motion parallax. Here we demonstrate with formal psychophysics that humans can exploit auditory motion parallax, i.e., the change in the dynamic binaural cues elicited by self-motion, to assess the relative depths of two sound sources. Our data show that sensitivity to relative depth is best when subjects move actively; performance deteriorates when subjects are moved by a motion platform or when the sound sources themselves move. This is true even though the dynamic binaural cues elicited by these three types of motion are identical. Our data demonstrate a perceptual strategy to segregate intermittent sound sources in depth and highlight the tight interaction between self-motion and binaural processing that allows assessment of the spatial layout of complex acoustic scenes.},

Vibrant reform and metascience movements have emerged. These are exciting developments and may point toward practical improvements in the future. Yet there is nothing so practical as good theory. This article outlines aspects of reform and metascience in psychology that are ripe for an injection of theory, including a lot of excellent and overlooked theoretical work from different disciplines. I review established frameworks that model the process of scientific discovery, the types of scientific networks that we ought to aspire to, and the processes by which problematic norms and institutions might evolve, focusing especially on modeling from the philosophy of science and cultural evolution. We have unwittingly evolved a toxic scientific ecosystem; existing interdisciplinary theory may help us intelligently design a better one.},

By recognizing and using these distinctions, however, we can make apparently stable ``errors'' disappear, reappear, or even invert.

  abstract = {Do subjects, in probability revision experiments, generally neglect base rates due to the use of a representativeness heuristic, or does the use of base rates depend on what we call the  internal problem representation? In Experiment 1, we used Kahneman and Tversky's (1973) engineer-lawyer problem, where random sampling of descriptions is crucial to the internal representation of the problem as one in probablity revision. If random sampling was performed and observed by the subjects themselves, then their judgments conformed more to Bayesian theory than to the representativeness hypothesis. If random sampling was only verbally asserted, judgments followed the representativeness heuristic. In Experiment 2 we used the soccer problem, which has the same formal structure but which the subjects' every day experience already represents as a probability revision problem. With this change in content, subjects' judgments were indistinguishable from Bayesian performance. We conclude that by manipulating presentation and content, one can elicit either base rate neglect or base rate use, as well as points in between. This result suggests that representativeness is neither an all-purpose mental strategy nor even a tendency, but rather a function of the content and the presentation of crucial information.

Here we focus on two approaches to theory specification and development that are typically associated with distinct research traditions: computational modeling and construct validation. We outline the points of convergence and divergence between them to illuminate the anatomy of a scientific theory in psychology---what a well-specified theory should contain and how it should be interrogated and revised through iterative theory-development processes. We propose how these two approaches can be used in complementary ways to increase the quality of explanations and the precision of predictions offered by psychological theories.},

  abstract = {Many organizations use affirmative action to increase diversity in their workforce. Although these programmes are well intentioned, previous research suggests there may be negative consequences that undermine or reduce their benefits. This three-level meta-analysis investigates responses to affirmative action by integrating 437 effect sizes from 78 studies. The results show that affirmative action elicits small to moderate negative effects. These negative reactions are moderated by three key factors: (1) the age of the study, with negative effects diminished in more recent studies; (2) the strength of affirmative action, with policies that provide more preferential treatment to their recipients regarded more negatively and (3) the outcome being measured, with judgments regarding fairness showing the largest negative effects. Notably, behavioural and intrapersonal outcomes, as well as tiebreak affirmative-action policies, do not appear to result in negative reactions. Although beneficiary status did not moderate the effect, subgroup analyses suggest that responses of non-beneficiaries were more unfavourable than those of beneficiaries. Analysis of possible publication bias and study quality suggest acceptable evidentiary value of the overall effect. Finally, the meta-analysis identifies important gaps that need to be addressed in future research to inform and optimize diversity, equity and inclusion policies and practices.},

  abstract = {Psychology endeavors to develop theories of human capacities and behaviors on the basis of a variety of methodologies and dependent measures. We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined---what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.},

  abstract = {In this article, I critically examine a number of widely held beliefs about the nature of replication and its place in science, with particular reference to psychology. In doing so, I present a number of underappreciated understandings of the nature of science more generally. I contend that some contributors to the replication debates overstate the importance of replication in science and mischaracterize the relationship between direct and conceptual replication. I also claim that there has been a failure to appreciate sufficiently the variety of legitimate replication practices that scientists engage in. In this regard, I highlight the tendency to pay insufficient attention to methodological triangulation as an important strategy for justifying empirical claims. I argue, further, that the replication debates tend to overstate the closeness of the relationship between replication and theory construction. Some features of this relationship are spelt out with reference to the hypothetico-deductive and the abductive accounts of scientific method. Additionally, an evaluation of the status of replication in different characterizations of scientific progress is undertaken. I maintain that viewing replication as just one element of the wide array of scientific endeavors leads to the conclusion that it is not as prominent in science as is often claimed.},

It seems particularly important to be able to provide accurate assessments of the probability with which negative events occur so as to guide rational choice of preventative actions. One question that arises here is whether or not our probability estimates for negative events are systematically biased by their severity. In a minimal experimental context involving an unambiguous, objective representation of probability, we found that participants judged a controllable event as more likely to occur when its utility was extremely negative than when it was more neutral. A decision-theoretic explanation based on loss function asymmetries is advanced which supports the claim that probability estimates are not intrinsically biased by utilities.},

Numerous \$p\$-value combination methods appear in the literature, each with different statistical properties, yet often the final choice used in a meta-analysis can seem arbitrary, as if all effort has been expended in building the models that gave rise to the \$p\$-values. Birnbaum (1954) showed that any reasonable \$p\$-value combiner must be optimal against some alternative hypothesis. Starting from this perspective and recasting each method of combining \$p\$-values as a likelihood ratio test, we present theoretical results for some standard combiners that provide guidance on how a powerful combiner might be chosen in practice.},

The current research examined the effects of decisional and academic procrastination on students' feeling of discomfort related to academic procrastination and the desire to change their procrastination habits. We assumed that academic procrastination would mediate the relationship between decisional procrastination and students' feelings toward academic procrastination. A total of 373 undergraduate social sciences students from northern Israel participated in the study. The results challenge the traditional perception that procrastination is mostly associated with feelings of discomfort and may imply that while decisional procrastinators experience discomfort associated with procrastination, academic procrastinators want to change their procrastination habits but do not report feelings of discomfort. The findings also suggest a difference between the two types of procrastination and may contribute to the argument that for some students, procrastination serves as an immediate emotional relief, followed by negative academic outcomes that enhance the desire to change this habit.

  abstract = {People often slow down their ongoing activities when they must remember an intended action, known as the cost or interference effect of prospective memory (PM). Only a few studies have examined adult age differences in PM interference, and the specific reasons underlying such differences are not well understood. The authors used a model-based approach to reveal processes underlying PM interference and age differences in these processes. Older and younger adults first performed a block of an ongoing lexical decision task alone. An embedded event-based PM task was added in a second block. Simultaneously accounting for the changes in response time distributions and error rates induced by the PM task, Ratcliff's (Psychological Review 85:59--108, 1978) diffusion model was used to decompose the nonlinear combination of speed and accuracy into psychologically meaningful components. Remembering an intention not only reduced processing efficiency in both age groups, but also prolonged peripheral nondecision times and induced response cautiousness. Overall, the findings suggest that there are multiple, but qualitatively similar factors underlying PM task interference in both age groups.},

In this registered report, we conducted an experimental investigation of motivational influence on remembering intentions after a delay (prospective memory; PM) in younger, middle-aged, and older adults, using gain- and loss-framing manipulations. The present study examined for the first time whether motivational framing in a PM task has different effects on younger and older adults' PM performance (N = 180; age range: 18--85 years) in a controlled laboratory setting. Based on lifespan theories of motivation, we assumed that the prevention of losses becomes more relevant with increasing age: We expected that older adults show relatively higher PM performance in a task with loss-related consequences following PM failure than in a task in which successful PM leads to gains. The opposite pattern of performance was expected for younger adults. The findings suggest that the relevance of reward and positive gain-related consequences for successful remembering appears to decrease with age. As hypothesised, a motivational framing {\texttimes} age interaction indicated that age differences in memory performance were smaller with loss-related than gain-related consequences, supporting a loss-prevention view on motivated cognition.},

  abstract = {Multilevel linear modeling (MLM) is a powerful and well-defined tool often used to evaluate time-varying associations between two or more variables measured in longitudinal studies. Such variables carry information about stable, between-person differences as well as information about within-person variability. For emerging adults, this variability figures prominently across a variety of developmental domains. A single variable measured on repeated occasions can be easily summarized into two new variables that represent the unique within- and between-person sources of information contained in the original variable. Well-known procedures for statistically disaggregating time-varying predictors in an MLM are straightforward but often not accessible to a nontechnical readership. Using SAS syntax, this tutorial provides step-by-step instructions to recode a single repeated-measures variable into separate between- and within-person predictor variables. Strategies are suggested for testing and interpreting main effects and interactions in the MLM, drawing on a daily diary example of first-year, first-time college-attending emerging adults.},

ADHD symptoms from 1,549 pairs were subjected to latent class and factor analysis.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Latent class and factor analyses were consistent with the presence of separate continuous domains of inattention (ATT), hyperactivity-impulsivity (H-I), and combined ATT with H-I problems. Severe latent classes corresponding to the predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined types were identified with lifetime prevalence estimates of 4.0\%, 2.2\%, and 3.7\%, respectively. Membership in the severe ATT class predicted academic problems, family problems, and referral to health care providers. Membership in the H-I and combined classes also predicted impaired social relationships.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}These results suggest that DSM-IV ADHD subtypes can be thought of as existing on separate continua of inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and combined type problems. Membership in any of the three severe ADHD latent classes did not preclude academic excellence, but it was associated with different types of impairment and health care-seeking behavior. These data have implications in the areas of diagnosis, classification, treatment, and research.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Replication studies have been presented as a way of directly supporting theory development by enabling researchers to more confidently and precisely test and update theoretical claims. In this article I use contemporary work from philosophy of science to make explicit and emphasize just how much theory development is required before ``good'' replication studies can be carried out and show just how little theoretical payoff even good conceptual replications offer. I suggest that in many areas of psychology aiming at replication is misplaced and that instead replication attempts are better seen as exploratory studies that can be used in the cumulative development of theory and measurement procedures.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses {$\alpha$}-admissiblility and d-admissiblity which are important concepts in studying the performance of statistical tests for composite hypotheses. A sufficient condition for {$\alpha$}-admissibility is presented. When {$\alpha$}=1/m, the Nomakuchi-Sakata test, which is uniformly more powerful than the likelihood ratio test for hypotheses min ({\texttheta}1, {\texttheta}1) = 0 versus min ({\texttheta}1, {\texttheta}1) {$>$} 0, is generalized for a class of distributions in an exponential family, and its unbiasedness and {$\alpha$}-admissibility are shown. Finally, the case of {$\alpha\neq$} 1/m is discussed in brief.},

  abstract = {Over the past 10\,years, Oosterhof and Todorov's valence--dominance model has emerged as the most prominent account of how people evaluate faces on social dimensions. In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance) underpin social judgements of faces. Because this model has primarily been developed and tested in Western regions, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other regions. We addressed this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov's methodology across 11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants. When we used Oosterhof and Todorov's original analysis strategy, the valence--dominance model generalized across regions. When we used an alternative methodology to allow for correlated dimensions, we observed much less generalization. Collectively, these results suggest that, while the valence--dominance model generalizes very well across regions when dimensions are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are revealed when we use different extraction methods and correlate and rotate the dimension reduction solution.},

(i) All monocular depth and familiarity cues were removed from the stimuli (through the use of randomdot stereo patterns). (ii) The statistical and topological properties of the stimuli were precisely known (since they were generated according to a specific computer program). (iii) Convergence motions of the eye and proprioceptive cues were eliminated (through the use of tachistoscopic illumination). (iv) The time of presentation was under control (through erasure of the persistent afterimages). Under these conditions stereopsis could be studied in its purest form. It was shown that depth can be perceived in the absence of monocular depth and familiarity cues and of all binocular depth cues except for disparity. These findings have important implications for some existing theories of stereopsis and open up areas for further research. Some phenomena based on stereo erasure are reported here for the first time. It has been demonstrated that the perception of ambiguous depth organizations can be influenced, even subliminally, by a preceding unambiguous stimulus. Perhaps the most interesting result is the finding that the correspondence of objects and patterns in the two retinal projections can be established without actual recognition of the objects and patterns. This pattern matching is based on some relatively simple processes of finding connected clusters formed by adjacent points of similar brightness, and the processes seem to be amenable to rigorous analysis.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we explore the rules that determine intuitive predictions and judgments of confidence and contrast these rules to the normative principles of statistical prediction. Two classes of prediction are discussed: category prediction and numerical prediction. In a categorical case, the prediction is given in nominal form, for example, the winner in an election, the diagnosis of a patient, or a person's future occupation. In a numerical case, the prediction is given in numerical form, for example, the future value of a particular stock or of a student's grade point average.In making predictions and judgments under uncertainty, people do not appear to follow the calculus of chance or the statistical theory of prediction. Instead, they rely on a limited number of heuristics which sometimes yield reasonable judgments and sometimes lead to severe and systematic errors (Kahneman \&amp; Tversky, 1972b, 3; Tversky \&amp; Kahneman, 1971, 2; 1973, 11). The present paper is concerned with the role of one of these heuristics -- representativeness -- in intuitive predictions.Given specific evidence (e.g., a personality sketch), the outcomes under consideration (e.g., occupations or levels of achievement) can be ordered by the degree to which they are representative of that evidence. The thesis of this paper is that people predict by representativeness, that is, they select or order outcomes by the degree to which the outcomes represent the essential features of the evidence.},

  abstract = {Paul Meehl's famous critique detailed many of the problematic practices and conceptual confusions that stand in the way of meaningful theoretical progress in psychological science. By integrating many of Meehl's points, we argue that one of the reasons for the slow progress in psychology is the failure to acknowledge the problem of coordination. This problem arises whenever we attempt to measure quantities that are not directly observable but can be inferred from observable variables. The solution to this problem is far from trivial, as demonstrated by a historical analysis of thermometry. The key challenge is the specification of a functional relationship between theoretical concepts and observations. As we demonstrate, empirical means alone cannot determine this relationship. In the case of psychology, the problem of coordination has dramatic implications in the sense that it severely constrains our ability to make meaningful theoretical claims. We discuss several examples and outline some of the solutions that are currently available.},

Before badges, less than 3\% of Psychological Science articles reported open data. After badges, 23\% reported open data, with an accelerating trend; 39\% reported open data in the first half of 2015, an increase of more than an order of magnitude from baseline. There was no change over time in the low rates of data sharing among comparison journals. Moreover, reporting openness does not guarantee openness. When badges were earned, reportedly available data were more likely to be actually available, correct, usable, and complete than when badges were not earned. Open materials also increased to a weaker degree, and there was more variability among comparison journals. Badges are simple, effective signals to promote open practices and improve preservation of data and materials by using independent repositories.},

  abstract = {The direction of an association at the population-level may be reversed within the subgroups comprising that population---a striking observation called Simpson's paradox. When facing this pattern, psychologists often view it as anomalous. Here, we argue that Simpson's paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretations -- potentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by drawing on empirical results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, psychopathology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's Paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered---including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's Paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.},

One explanation derived from the multiprocess framework proposes that age differences depend on whether the cue to carry out a prospective intention is focal to ongoing task processing. A meta-analysis of 117 effect sizes from 4,709 participants provided evidence for this view, as age effects were greater when the prospective cue to the ongoing task was nonfocal compared with when it was focal. However, the results only support a weaker but not a stronger prediction of the multiprocess framework, as age impairments were reliably above zero for both types of retrieval cues.},

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

  abstract = {Many researchers rely on meta-analysis to summarize research evidence. However, there is a concern that publication bias and selective reporting may lead to biased meta-analytic effect sizes. We compare the results of meta-analyses to large-scale preregistered replications in psychology carried out at multiple laboratories. The multiple-laboratory replications provide precisely estimated effect sizes that do not suffer from publication bias or selective reporting. We searched the literature and identified 15\,meta-analyses on the same topics as multiple-laboratory replications. We find that meta-analytic effect sizes are significantly different from replication effect sizes for 12 out of the 15\,meta-replication pairs. These differences are systematic and, on average, meta-analytic effect sizes are almost three times as large as replication effect sizes. We also implement three methods of correcting meta-analysis for bias, but these methods do not substantively improve the meta-analytic results.},

Suppose there are univariate test statistics Si that contrast the identified treatment with treatment i for i = 1, 2,..., K. The min test is defined to be the {$\alpha$}-level procedure that rejects the null hypothesis that the identified treatment is not best when, for all i, Si rejects the one-sided hypothesis, at the {$\alpha$}-level, that the identified treatment is not better than the ith treatment. In the normal case where Si are t statistics the min test is the likelihood ratio test. For distributions satisfying mild regularity conditions, if attention is restricted to test statistics that are monotone nondecreasing functions of Si, then regardless of their covariance structure the min test is an optimal {$\alpha$}-level test. Tables of the sample size needed to achieve power .5, .8, .90, and .95 are given for the min test when the Si are Student's t and Wilcoxon.},

  abstract = {Lecture recordings are increasingly used to supplement lecture attendance within higher education, but their impact on student learning remains unclear. Here we describe a study to evaluate student use of lecture recordings and quantify their impact on academic performance. Questionnaire responses and online monitoring of student's access to recordings indicate that {$\sim$}75\% students use this material, the majority in a targeted manner. In contrast, a small subset of students ({$\sim$}5\%) are highly dependent on recordings downloading every lecture, and viewing the material for long periods, such that this represents a large proportion of their independent study. This `high user' group is atypical, as it contains a high proportion of dyslexic and Non-English Speaking Background students. Despite high usage, lecture recordings do not have a significant impact on academic performance, either across the cohort or with students that use the recordings. Overall, this approach appears to be beneficial, but may reduce lecture attendance and encourage surface learning approaches in a minority of students.

However, while the research on the effectiveness of gamification in the context of education has been growing, there are blind spots regarding which types of gamification may be suitable for different educational contexts. This study investigates the effects of the challenge-based gamification on learning in the area of statistics education. We developed a gamification approach, called Horses for Courses, which is composed of main game design patterns related to the challenge-based gamification; points, levels, challenges and a leaderboard. Having conducted a 2 (read: yes vs. no) x 2 (gamification: yes vs. no) between-subject experiment, we present a quantitative analysis of the performance of 365 students from two different academic majors: Electrical and Computer Engineering (n=279), and Business Administration (n=86). The results of our experiments show that the challenge-based gamification had a positive impact on student learning compared to traditional teaching methods (compared to having no treatment and treatment involving reading exercises). The effect was larger for females or for students at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.},

  abstract = {Objectives Within-couple similarities in personality traits tend to be positively associated with relationship well-being. However, research in this area is typically based on cross-sectional designs, thereby limiting examination of longitudinal personality concordance. Given that life experiences shape within-person change in personality, and that partners within a couple often experience similar life events, investigation of within-couple personality synchrony and associations with marital outcomes is warranted. Methods Using data from 3,988 couples (mean age at baseline = 67.0 years, SD = 9.6), multilevel dyadic growth models estimated within-couple similarity in baseline levels, change, and occasion-to-occasion variability for each of the Big Five personality traits over an 8-year follow-up. Bivariate growth models examined the effect of within-couple similarity on perceived spousal support, accounting for dependency within couples. Results Adjusting for baseline age, education, functional ability, and relationship length, analyses revealed within-couple concordance between baseline levels of all 5 personality traits, as well as correlated within-couple fluctuations in neuroticism, extraversion, and openness over time. Similarity in openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism trajectories predicted spousal support. Couples were most similar in openness, showing correlated intercepts, change, and variability, and this longitudinal synchrony was particularly important for perceived spousal support in women. Discussion These findings provide evidence for longitudinal personality synchrony over time within older adult couples. Further, concordance in neuroticism, extraversion, and openness predicted perceived spousal support, though there may be some gender differences in personality dynamics and relationship well-being. Effects of similarity were relatively small compared to actor and partner effects of these traits.},

  abstract = {A series of 5 experiments with 660 adult Ss studied how people judge the frequency of death from various causes. The judgments exhibited a highly consistent but systematically biased subjective scale of frequency. Two kinds of bias were identified: (a) a tendency to overestimate small frequencies and underestimate larger ones; and (b) a tendency to exaggerate the frequency of some specific causes and to underestimate the frequency of others, at any given level of objective frequency. These biases were traced to a number of possible sources, including disproportionate exposure, memorability, or imaginability of various events. Ss were unable to correct for these sources of bias when specifically instructed to avoid them. Comparisons with previous laboratory studies are discussed, along with methods for improving frequency judgments and the implications of the present findings for the management of societal hazards.

When testing theories, experiments must be internally valid but do not have to be externally valid. However, when experiments are used to search for and document phenomena, develop theories, or advise policymakers, external validity matters. Conflating these goals and failing to recognize their tensions with validity concerns can lead to problems with theorizing. Psychological scientists should be aware of the mutual-internal-validity problem, long recognized by experimental economists. When phenomena elicited by experiments are used to develop theories that, in turn, influence the design of theory-testing experiments, experiments and theories can become wedded to each other and lose touch with reality. They capture and explain phenomena within but not beyond the laboratory. We highlight how triangulation can address validity problems by helping experiments and theories make contact with ideas from other disciplines and the real world.},

  abstract = {During the academic year 2019--2020, school buildings worldwide closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating a rapid shift to distance education. This study assessed the influence of high-speed broadband availability on student engagement with distance learning during this period in Ireland. Employing data from a representative sample of 206 secondary schools, student engagement as perceived by school principals was estimated to have been more adversely affected among schools located in areas with lower coverage of high-speed broadband. This may be partly explained by a lower probability of poorer student engagement among schools that deployed live online video teaching. While the costs and benefits must be considered, these findings may support the case for government intervention to provide greater equity in access to high-speed broadband. Where distance learning is required in future, secondary teachers should be supported in the use of live online teaching to better foster student engagement.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with testing the hypothesis that the parameter in a multivariate exponential distribution lies in a linear subspace of the natural parameter space. Our main result characterizes a complete class of tests which is independent of the particular exponential distribution. This class is, in fact, complete relative to the stronger ordering among tests which compares conditional power, given a certain statistic, pointwise. The conclusion holds without any restriction on the exponential distribution. Many of the tests are admissible, but examples show that although the class is essentially the smallest class complete relative to all exponential distributions, it is not in general minimally complete. Some special cases where the class is minimally complete are discussed.},

  abstract = {Framing effects are well established: Listeners' preferences depend on how outcomes are described to them, or framed. Less well understood is what determines how speakers choose frames. Two experiments revealed that reference points systematically influenced speakers' choices between logically equivalent frames. For example, speakers tended to describe a 4-ounce cup filled to the 2-ounce line as half full if it was previously empty but described it as half empty if it was previously full. Similar results were found when speakers could describe the outcome of a medical treatment in terms of either mortality or survival (e.g., 25\% die vs. 75\% survive). Two additional experiments showed that listeners made accurate inferences about speakers' reference points on the basis of the selected frame (e.g., if a speaker described a cup as half empty, listeners inferred that the cup used to be full). Taken together, the data suggest that frames reliably convey implicit information in addition to their explicit content, which helps explain why framing effects are so robust.},

  abstract = {Replication is an important contemporary issue in psychological research, and there is great interest in ways of assessing replicability, in particular, retrospectively via prior studies. The average power of a set of prior studies is a quantity that has attracted considerable attention for this purpose, and techniques to estimate this quantity via a meta-analytic approach have recently been proposed. In this article, we have two aims. First, we clarify the nature of average power and its implications for replicability. We explain that average power is not relevant to the replicability of actual prospective replication studies. Instead, it relates to efforts in the history of science to catalogue the power of prior studies. Second, we evaluate the statistical properties of point estimates and interval estimates of average power obtained via the meta-analytic approach. We find that point estimates of average power are too variable and inaccurate for use in application. We also find that the width of interval estimates of average power depends on the corresponding point estimates; consequently, the width of an interval estimate of average power cannot serve as an independent measure of the precision of the point estimate. Our findings resolve a seeming puzzle posed by three estimates of the average power of the power-posing literature obtained via the meta-analytic approach.},

This collection of papers is, and is likely to remain for a long time, one of the most important books in sociology."---Joseph Ben-David, New York Times Book Review"The novelty of the approach, the erudition and elegance, and the unusual breadth of vision make this volume one of the most important contributions to sociology in general and to the sociology of science in particular. . . . Merton's Sociology of Science is a magisterial summary of the field."---Yehuda Elkana, American Journal of Sociology"Merton's work provides a rich feast for any scientist concerned for a genuine understanding of his own professional self. And Merton's industry, integrity, and humility are permanent witnesses to that ethos which he has done so much to define and support."---J. R. Ravetz, American Scientist"The essays not only exhibit a diverse and penetrating analysis and a deal of historical and contemporary examples, with concrete numerical data, but also make genuinely good reading because of the wit, the liveliness and the rich learning with which Merton writes."---Philip Morrison, Scientific American"Merton's impact on sociology as a whole has been large, and his impact on the sociology of science has been so momentous that the title of the book is apt, because Merton's writings represent modern sociology of science more than any other single writer."---Richard McClintock, Contemporary Sociology},

  abstract = {The role of attentional processes in the integration of input from different sensory modalities is complex and multifaceted. Importantly, little is known about how simple, non-linguistic stimuli are integrated when the resources available for sensory processing are exhausted. We studied this question by examining multisensory integration under conditions of limited endogenous attentional resources. Multisensory integration was assessed through the sound-induced flash illusion (SIFI), in which a flash presented simultaneously with two short auditory beeps is often perceived as two flashes, while cognitive load was manipulated using an n-back task. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that increased cognitive demands had a significant effect on the perception of the illusion while post-hoc tests showed that participants' illusion perception was increased when attentional resources were limited. Additional analysis demonstrated that this effect was not related to a response bias. These findings provide evidence that the integration of non-speech, audiovisual stimuli is enhanced under reduced attentional resources and it therefore supports the notion that top-down attentional control plays an essential role in multisensory integration.},

  abstract = {Recent works have called into question whether p-curve can reliably assess the presence of "evidential value" within a set of studies. To examine an as-yet unexplored issue, we examined the method used to identify p-values for inclusion in a p-curve analysis. We developed iterated p-curve analysis (IPA), which calculates and p-curves every permutation for a set of reported p-values, and applied it to the data reported in several published p-curve analyses. Specifically, we investigated two phenomena for which p-curves have been used to evaluate the presence of evidential value: the power pose and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) reactivity debates. The iterated p-curve analyses revealed that the p-curve method fails to provide reliable estimates or reproducible conclusions. We conclude that p-curve should not be used to make conclusions regarding the presence or absence of evidence for a specific phenomenon.},

Their alternative interpretations, while correct, cannot be deemed acceptable renderings of the questions in the survey due to the well-known reference class problem. Moreover, there is no support in the data for their contention that participants may have had their alternative interpretations in mind.

These simplifying assumptions often take the form of statistical null hypotheses; hence, supporting these simplifying assumptions with statistical evidence is crucial to scientific progress, though it might involve ``accepting'' a null hypothesis. We review two historical examples in which statistical evidence was used to accept a simplifying assumption (that there is no luminiferous ether and that genetic traits are passed on in discrete forms) and one in which the null hypothesis was not accepted despite repeated failures (gravitational waves), drawing lessons from each. We emphasize the role of the scientific context in acceptance of the null: Accepting a null hypothesis is never a purely statistical affair.},

Change detection is especially useful for studying visual working memory, because recall paradigms are difficult to employ in the visual modality. Pashler (Perception \& Psychophysics, 44, 369-378, 1988) and Cowan (Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24, 87-114, 2001) suggested formulas for estimating working memory capacity from change detection data. Although these formulas have become widely used, Morey (Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 55, 8-24, 2011) showed that the formulas suffer from a number of issues, including inefficient use of information, bias, volatility, uninterpretable parameter estimates, and violation of ANOVA assumptions. Morey presented a hierarchical Bayesian extension of Pashler's and Cowan's basic models that mitigates these issues. Here, we present WoMMBAT (Working Memory Modeling using Bayesian Analysis Techniques) software for fitting Morey's model to data. WoMMBAT has a graphical user interface, is freely available, and is cross-platform, running on Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.},

  abstract = {Universities, globally, are increasingly offering students a blended learning approach to support their campus-based education, through use of a wide range of educational technologies, tools and systems. Research has demonstrated that blended learning offers at least equivalent learning outcomes for students, and enhances flexibility, inclusivity, engagement and motivation. Many universities across the world (including Australia, the US, Canada, Singapore, Qatar, and across Europe) have adopted lecture capture as a means to support a blended learning approach, and students have strong positive perceptions about the value of lecture recordings to enhance their learning and support their education. However, research shows that teaching staff are generally less positive about the value of lecture capture, believing it to diminish the value of the live lecture experience, reduce learning, and encourage student absenteeism from lectures. In this study, we used mixed methods and repeated cross-sectional data collection to investigate the use and value of lecture recordings from the perspective of students and teaching staff in a large campus-based university, employing a blended learning approach. Our data show that students make significant use of lecture recordings, throughout the academic session, and place great value on recordings for note-taking, more in-depth understanding or clarification, and assessment preparation. As a result, students have high expectations about the availability and quality of recordings. Teaching staff reported a range of reservations about the value of lecture recordings, including its impact on teaching style, and strong concerns about the negative impact of lecture recordings on students learning and attendance. Our data show that over 80\% of students attended recorded lectures, but lectures that weren't recorded had significantly higher attendance. In conclusion, our research demonstrates a contested space between staff and students in relation to the use and value of lecture recordings, a contested space that will need to be debated and resolved as universities grow their use of blended learning. This study contributes significantly to this global debate by its use of a wide range of additional data sets to delve further and provide a more nuanced view of this space.

  abstract = {According to social cognition textbooks, stereotypes are activated automatically if appropriate categorical cues are processed. Although many studies have tested effects of activated stereotypes on behavior, few have tested the process of stereotype activation. Blair and Banaji (1996) demonstrated that subjects were faster to categorize first names as male or female if those were preceded by gender congruent attribute primes. The same, albeit smaller, effects emerged in a semantic priming design ruling out response priming by Banaji and Hardin (1996). We sought to replicate these important effects. Mirroring Blair and Banaji (1996) we found strong priming effects as long as response priming was possible. However, unlike Banaji and Hardin (1996), we did not find any evidence for automatic stereotype activation, when response priming was ruled out. Our findings suggest that automatic stereotype activation is not a reliable and global phenomenon but is restricted to more specific conditions.},

We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

In reality there is no rule of thumb that applies to all situations. The sample size needed for a study depends on many factors, including the size of the model, distribution of the variables, amount of missing data, reliability of the variables, and strength of the relations among the variables. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how substantive researchers can use a Monte Carlo study to decide on sample size and determine power. Two models are used as examples, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model and a growth model. The analyses are carried out using the Mplus program (Muth{\'e}n\& Muth{\'e}n 1998).},

  abstract = {One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery. Concerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research. Reproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.},

  abstract = {It is commonplace, when discussing the subject of psychological theory, to write articles from the assumption that psychology differs from the physical sciences in that we have no theories that would support cumulative, incremental science. In this brief article I discuss one counterexample: Shepard's law of generalization and the various Bayesian extensions that it inspired over the past 3 decades. Using Shepard's law as a running example, I argue that psychological theory building is not a statistical problem, mathematical formalism is beneficial to theory, measurement and theory have a complex relationship, rewriting old theory can yield new insights, and theory growth can drive empirical work. Although I generally suggest that the tools of mathematical psychology are valuable to psychological theorists, I also comment on some limitations to this approach.},

For students, we suggest that the importance of attendance and effective note-taking should be reinforced, as well as specifying how lecture capture can best be used as a catch-up or revision aid. For instructors, we highlight the need to provide guidance for students on how to learn and to adopt a context-dependent approach to lecture capture based on pedagogical considerations, rather than all-or-nothing. Regarding the issue of the relationship between lecture capture and attendance, we suggest the focus should move to a more nuanced discussion of why students fail to attend lectures and how they are using lecture capture. Finally, we discuss other concerns commonly raised by instructors related to lecture capture. Our student guidance is available for dissemination in infographic form at https://osf.io/esd2q/files/.

We conclude that traditional on-campus lectures, and the recordings of those lectures have a place in higher education and the suggestion that they should be abandoned is as unhelpful as the suggestion that they should be the default mode of teaching. When lectures are deliberately chosen as the most appropriate method of teaching and when the same pedagogical care and attention is given as to other modes of delivery, they provide an effective, pragmatic solution, particularly for large classes.},

This includes delivering face-to-face programs fully online for at least part of the upcoming academic year for new and continuing cohorts. This temporary pivot will necessitate distance teaching and learning across almost every conceivable pedagogy, from fundamental degrees to professionally accredited ones. Each institution, program, and course will have its own myriad of individualized needs; however, there is a common question that unites us all: how do we provide teaching and assessment to students in a manner that is accessible, fair, equitable, and provides the best learning whilst acknowledging the temporary nature of the pivot? No ``one size fits all'' solution exists, and many of the choices that need to be made will be far from simple; however, this paper provides a starting point and basic principles to facilitate discussions taking place around the globe by balancing what we know from the pedagogy of online learning with the practicalities imposed by this crisis and any future crises.},

  abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes---a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

  abstract = {A sample of 56 general practitioners were asked to rate, on a percentage scale, 23 words or phrases which denote frequency or likelihood. The hypothetical context of the exercise was that of communicating to patients the probability of a side-effect (headache) arising from an unspecified prescription medicine. Median phrase ratings ranged from 'never' at 0\% to 'certain' at 95\% with a 50\% rating given to the phrase 'reasonable chance'. Despite relatively large variance in ratings between respondents, the median ratings of a number of phrases were similar, and some identical, to other studies from different medical professionals. Although the clinical context in which a given expression of probability is used may affect its meaning, the results are encouraging and suggest that phrases denoting likelihood might be systematically codified to enhance communication between doctor and patient. To move towards this objective more research is needed to evaluate how patients interpret expressions of probability, and the relative effectiveness of different modes of communicating likelihood.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of digital technologies by young people has spurred speculation that their regular use negatively impacts psychological well-being. Current empirical evidence supporting this idea is largely based on secondary analyses of large-scale social datasets. Though these datasets provide a valuable resource for highly powered investigations, their many variables and observations are often explored with an analytical flexibility that marks small effects as statistically significant, thereby leading to potential false positives and conflicting results. Here we address these methodological challenges by applying specification curve analysis (SCA) across three large-scale social datasets (total n\,=\,355,358) to rigorously examine correlational evidence for the effects of digital technology on adolescents. The association we find between digital technology use and adolescent well-being is negative but small, explaining at most 0.4\% of the variation in well-being. Taking the broader context of the data into account suggests that these effects are too small to warrant policy change.},

It was thought to be inadmissible for over fifty years, dating back to a paper of Birnbaum [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 49 (1954) 559--574]. It turns out that the method Birnbaum analyzed is not the one that Pearson proposed. We show that Pearson's proposal is admissible. Because it is admissible, it has better power than the standard test of Fisher [Statistical Methods for Research Workers (1932) Oliver and Boyd] at some alternatives, and worse power at others. Pearson's method has the advantage when all or most of the nonzero parameters share the same sign. Pearson's test has proved useful in a genomic setting, screening for age-related genes. This paper also presents an FFT-based method for getting hard upper and lower bounds on the CDF of a sum of nonnegative random variables.},

In the ACE, people process sentences implying movement toward or away from themselves, responding with actions toward or away from their bodies. These processes interact, implying a linkage between linguistic and motor systems. From a theoretical perspective, the ACE has been extremely influential, being widely-cited evidence in favor of embodied cognition. The present study began as an attempt to extend the ACE in a new direction, but eventually became a series of attempts to simply replicate the effect. Across eight experiments, I tested whether the ACE extends to a novel mouse-tracking method and/or is susceptible to higher-order cognitive influences. In three experiments, attempts were made to ``disembody'' the ACE by presenting participants' names on the computer screen (as in ). In each experiment, the ACE could not be disembodied, because the ACE did not occur. In further experiments, the ACE was not observed in reading times, regardless of response mode (mouse movements versus button-presses) or stimuli, including those from the original research. Similarly, no ACE was observed in physical movement times. Bayes Factor analyses of the current experiments, and the previous ACE literature, suggest that the evidence for the ACE is generally weak: Many studies considered as positive evidence actually support the null hypothesis, and very few published results offer strong evidence for the ACE. Implications for the embodiment hypothesis are discussed.},

Based on the social accuracy model, our analyses distinguished similarity between partners that was attributable to similarity to an average person (normative similarity) and resemblance to the target participant himself/herself (self-partner similarity) to more precisely examine similarity from partner to partner (distinctive similarity). The results revealed a significant degree of distinctive partner similarity, suggesting that there may indeed be a unique type of person each individual ends up with. We also found that distinctive partner similarity was weaker for people high in extraversion or openness to experience, suggesting that these individuals may be less likely to be in a relationship with someone similar to their ex-partner (although the individual difference effects were not mirrored in an alternative analytic approach). These findings provide evidence for stability in distinctive partner personality and have important implications for predicting future partnering behaviors and actions in romantic relationships.},

  abstract = {The use of virtual reality (VR) is associated with several adverse effects including dizziness, headache, and motion sickness. This study investigates how full-immersion VR games cause changes in static balance with associated adverse effects, and whether a fixed or a changing game background is more likely to contribute to such problems. Static balance and adverse effects (eye fatigue and dizziness) were measured in 15 healthy adults under three conditions: baseline; after a full-immersion virtual reality game (PlayStation 4 Pro and PlayStation{\textregistered} VR headset) with a fixed background (15 min); and after a full-immersion virtual reality game with a unfixed background (15 min). Static balance was measured with an AMTI force plate, while eye fatigue and dizziness were measured with the Virtual Reality Symptom Questionnaire (VRSQ) and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). It was determined that playing a full-immersion VR game had a negative effect on static balance and produced several adverse effects including eye fatigue and dizziness. Moreover, sway velocity and sway length increased significantly in the game with a moving background compared to both the baseline and the game with a fixed background (p {$<$} 0.05); VRSQ and SSQ were also significantly higher in this case. It is thus preferable from the perspective of reducing adverse effects that only fixed-background full-immersion VR games be used in rehabilitative interventions.},

These examples, which arise in multiparameter hypothesis testing problems, have several common features. In each case the null hypothesis is composite, the size LRT is not similar and hence biased, and competing size tests can be constructed that are less biased, or even unbiased, and that dominate the LRT in the sense of being everywhere more powerful. It is therefore asserted that in these examples and, by implication, many other testing problems, the LR criterion produces ``inferior,'' ``deficient,'' `` undesirable,'' or ``flawed'' statistical procedures. This message, which appears to be proliferating, is wrong. In each example it is the allegedly superior test that is flawed, not the LRT. At worst, the ``superior'' tests provide unwarranted and inappropriate inferences and have been deemed scientifically unacceptable by applied statisticians. This reinforces the well-documented but oft-neglected fact that the Neyman-Pearson theory desideratum of a more or most powerful size test may be scientifically inappropriate; the same is true for the criteria of unbiasedness and -admissibility. Although the LR criterion is not infallible, we believe that it remains a generally reasonable first option for non-Bayesian parametric hypothesis-testing problems.},

  abstract = {Dogs exhibit characteristic looking patterns when looking at human faces but little is known about what the underlying cognitive mechanisms are and how much these are influenced by individual experience. In Experiment 1, seven dogs were trained in a simultaneous discrimination procedure to assess whether they could discriminate a) the owner's face parts (eyes, nose or mouth) presented in isolation and b) whole faces where the same parts were covered. Dogs discriminated all the three parts of the owner's face presented in isolation, but needed fewer sessions to reach the learning criterion for the eyes than for both nose and mouth. Moreover, covering the eyes region significantly disrupted face discriminability compared to the whole face condition while such difference was not found when the nose or mouth was hidden. In Experiment 2, dogs were presented with manipulated images of the owner's face (inverted, blurred, scrambled, grey-scale) to test the relative contribution of part-based and configural processing in the discrimination of human faces. Furthermore, by comparing the dogs enrolled in the previous experiment and seven `na{\"i}ve' dogs we examined if the relative contribution of part-based and configural processing was affected by dogs' experience with the face stimuli. Na{\"i}ve dogs discriminated the owner only when configural information was provided, whereas expert dogs could discriminate the owner also when part-based processing was necessary. The present study provides the first evidence that dogs can discriminate isolated internal features of a human face and corroborate previous reports of salience of the eyes region for human face processing. Although the reliance on part-perception may be increased by specific experience, our findings suggest that human face discrimination by dogs relies mainly on configural rather than on part-based elaboration.},

  abstract = {More than 40 years ago, Paul Meehl (1978) published a seminal critique of the state of theorizing in psychological science. According to Meehl, the quality of theories had diminished in the preceding decades, resulting in statistical methods standing in for theoretical rigor. In this introduction to the special issue Theory in Psychological Science, we apply Meehl's account to contemporary psychological science. We suggest that by the time of Meehl's writing, psychology found itself in the midst of a crisis that is typical of maturing sciences, in which the theories that had been guiding research were gradually cast into doubt. Psychologists were faced with the same general choice when worldviews fail: Face reality and pursue knowledge in the absence of certainty, or shift emphasis toward sources of synthetic certainty. We suggest that psychologists have too often chosen the latter option, substituting synthetic certainties for theory-guided research, in much the same manner as Scholastic scholars did centuries ago. Drawing from our contributors, we go on to make recommendations for how psychological science may fully reengage with theory-based science.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a growing chorus of researchers has argued that psychological theory is in a state of crisis: Theories are rarely developed in a way that indicates an accumulation of knowledge. Paul Meehl raised this very concern more than 40 years ago. Yet in the ensuing decades, little has improved. We aim to chart a better path forward for psychological theory by revisiting Meehl's criticisms, his proposed solution, and the reasons his solution failed to meaningfully change the status of psychological theory. We argue that Meehl identified serious shortcomings in our evaluation of psychological theories and that his proposed solution would substantially strengthen theory testing. However, we also argue that Meehl failed to provide researchers with the tools necessary to construct the kinds of rigorous theories his approach required. To advance psychological theory, we must equip researchers with tools that allow them to better generate, evaluate, and develop their theories. We argue that formal theories provide this much-needed set of tools, equipping researchers with tools for thinking, evaluating explanation, enhancing measurement, informing theory development, and promoting the collaborative construction of psychological theories.},

  abstract = {Correlation does not imply causation; but often, observational data are the only option, even though the research question at hand involves causality. This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables---colliders and mediators---should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

The R package lavaan has been developed to provide applied researchers, teachers, and statisticians, a free, fully open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling. This paper explains the aims behind the development of the package, gives an overview of its most important features, and provides some examples to illustrate how lavaan works in practice.},

  abstract = {In this chapter we present such an alterative: hierarchical modeling. In a hierarchical model, variability from the process of interest, as well as from nuisance sources such as from individuals and from items, are modeled simultaneously. The input to these models is the raw, unaggregated data, and the outputs are process parameter estimates across individuals and items. In this regard, not only can the behavior of these process estimates be studied across conditions, but across individuals and items as well, and this later activity provides a process-model informed study of individual (and item) differences. Hence, hierarchical models turn a problem, how to account for nuisance variation that cloud our view of process, into a strength. Hierarchical models provide both a clearer view of process and a means of exploring how these processes vary across populations of individuals or items. Not surprisingly, hierarchical linear models, models that extend ANOVA and regression to account for multiple sources of variance, are common in many areas of psychology, as well as across the social sciences.

  abstract = {The law of likelihood explains how to interpret statistical data as evidence. Specifically, it gives to the discipline of statistics a precise and objective measure of the strength of statistical evidence supporting one probability distribution vis-a-vis another. That measure is the likelihood ratio. But evidence, even when properly interpreted, can be misleading-observations can truly constitute strong evidence supporting one distribution when the other is true. What makes statistical evidence valuable to science is that this cannot occur very often. Here we examine two bounds on the probability of observing strong misleading evidence. One is a universal bound, applicable to every pair of probability distributions. The other bound, much smaller, applies to all pairs of distributions within fixed-dimensional parametric models in large samples. The second bound comes from examining how the probability of strong misleading evidence varies as a function of the alternative value of the parameter. We show that in large samples one curve describes how this probability first rises and then falls as the alternative moves away from the true parameter value for a very wide class of models. We also show that this large-sample curve, and the bound that its maximum value represents, applies to profile likelihood ratios for one-dimensional parameters in fixed-dimensional parametric models, but does not apply to the estimated likelihood ratios that result from replacing the nuisance parameters by their global maximum likelihood estimates.},

  abstract = {People have a strong tendency to attend to reward cues, even if these cues are irrelevant to their current goal or their current task. When reward cues are goal-irrelevant, their presence may impair cognitive performance. In this meta-analysis, we quantitatively examined the rapidly growing literature on the impact of reward-related distractors on cognitive performance. We included 91 studies (N = 2,362) that used different cognitive paradigms (e.g., visual search, conflict processing) and reward-related stimuli (e.g., money, attractive food). Overall, results showed that reward-related distractors impaired cognitive performance across different tasks and stimuli, with a small effect size (standardized mean change = .347). Between-study heterogeneity was large, suggesting that researchers can plausibly expect to sometimes find reversed effects (i.e., reward-related distractors boosting performance). We further showed that the average reward-driven distraction effect was robust across different reward-learning mechanisms, contexts, and methodological choices, and that this effect existed regardless of explicit task instructions to ignore distractors. In sum, the findings of this meta-analysis support the notion that cognitive processes can be thwarted by reward cues. We discuss these findings against the background of distraction-related phenomena as they are studied in clinical, educational, and work psychology.

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced higher education institutions to implement online learning activities based on virtual platforms, allowing little time to prepare and train faculty members to familiarize students with digital technologies. While previous studies have looked at how students engaged with digital technologies in their learning activities, the characteristics of the student engagement in online learning remain underexplored. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on student engagement in online learning in higher education is much needed. This article synthesizes the findings on student engagement in Latin American higher education institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the studies on online learning activities, this review examines student engagement from behavioural, cognitive and affective dimensions and identifies the main characteristics of student engagement from these tripartite dimensions. The implications of the findings for online learning in Latin American higher education are as follows: (a) to transform higher education, (b) to provide adequate professional training, (c) to improve Internet connectivity, (d) to ensure quality online learning in higher education and (e) to provide emotional support. These findings will provide valuable guidance for teachers, educational authorities and policy makers and help them make informed decisions to use effective strategies to support online learning in higher education institutions. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the normal operation of higher education institutions across Latin America, impelling a shift from face-to-face instruction to online teaching and learning. Research on online learning in Latin American higher education has been conducted, but the findings and their implications are yet to be widely disseminated among researchers, practitioners and decision-makers. What this paper adds Providing a systematic review of research on student engagement in online learning in Latin American higher education institutions. Analyzing the construct of student engagement in online learning from tripartite dimensions---behavioral, cognitive and affective---in the Latin American higher education context. Identifying the characteristics associated to each dimension of student engagement in online learning. Implications for practice and/or policy The need to transform the higher education system in Latin America and beyond, at two levels: to improve Internet connectivity at the technological level and to ensure the quality of online education at the pedagogical level. The urgency to offer an adequate professional training regarding the use of new technologies in online learning environments. The significance for higher education institutions to provide emotional support for students during the COVID-10 pandemic.},

  abstract = {Emotional experiences are known to be both perceived and remembered differently from nonemotional experiences, often leading to heightened encoding of salient visual details and subjectively vivid recollection. The vast majority of previous studies have used static images to investigate how emotional event content modulates cognition, yet natural events unfold over time. Therefore, little is known about how emotion dynamically modulates continuous experience. Here we report a norming study wherein we developed a new stimulus set of 126 emotionally negative, positive, and neutral videos depicting real-life news events. Participants continuously rated the valence of each video during its presentation and judged the overall emotional intensity and valence at the end of each video. In a subsequent memory test, participants reported how vividly they could recall the video details and estimated each video's duration. We report data on the affective qualities and subjective memorability of each video. The results replicate the well-established effect that emotional experiences are remembered more vividly than nonemotional experiences. Importantly, this novel stimulus set will facilitate research into the temporal dynamics of emotional processing and memory.},

  abstract = {Over recent years the use of lecture capture technology has become widespread in higher education. However, clear evidence of the learning benefits of this technology is limited, with contradictory findings reported in the literature. The reasons for this lack of consistent evidence may include methodological issues and differences in the context of previous studies. This paper describes a study using server log data to explore student use of video recordings quantitatively in the context of science courses at Imperial College London. The study had two aims: to understand more about the general principles that underpin a learning analytics study and to seek answers to the following specific research questions: (1) How much use is made of video recordings? (2) How does the use of recordings in a module vary over time? (3) Is the use of recordings different for different modules or subjects? (4) Is the use of recordings different for subgroups of students, for example, students with specific learning differences or English as a second language, students attaining different grades? (5) Is the use of recordings different for different types of content? Using learning analytics enabled the discovery of context-specific actionable insights: recommendations for both staff and students and ideas for further research. General conclusions were also drawn on how best to undertake learning analytics studies in order to deliver evidence and insights to improve learning and teaching.Published: 28 December 2018Citation: Research in Learning Technology 2018,~26: 2087 -~http://dx.doi.org/10.25304/rlt.v26.2087},

  abstract = {For almost half a century, Paul Meehl educated psychologists about how the mindless use of null-hypothesis significance tests made research on theories in the social sciences basically uninterpretable. In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalizing procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and influential. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychological scientists have begun to realize that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound ``derivation chain'' between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various nonconfirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and the functional form of those relationships, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognized and incentivized as a crucial goal in itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to nonconfirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology's reform movement and help us to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged.},

Respondents were asked to translate each term into a number on a scale from 0 to 10. There was a wide range of interpretation of the expressions, and significant differences were found between the mothers and medical group for seven of the expressions. Most mothers expressed a preference for receiving information in numerical terms. We advise that verbal probability expressions should be restricted, and more information presented in numerical terms.},

  abstract = {In order to assess the effect of a health care intervention, it is useful to look at an ensemble of relevant studies. The Cochrane Collaboration's admirable goal is to provide systematic reviews of all relevant clinical studies, in order to establish whether or not there is a conclusive evidence about a specific intervention. This is done mainly by conducting a meta-analysis: a statistical synthesis of results from a series of systematically collected studies. Health practitioners often interpret a significant meta-analysis summary effect as a statement that the treatment effect is consistent across a series of studies. However, the meta-analysis significance may be driven by an effect in only one of the studies. Indeed, in an analysis of two domains of Cochrane reviews we show that in a non-negligible fraction of reviews, the removal of a single study from the meta-analysis of primary endpoints makes the conclusion non-significant. Therefore, reporting the evidence towards replicability of the effect across studies in addition to the significant meta-analysis summary effect will provide credibility to the interpretation that the effect was replicated across studies. We suggest an objective, easily computed quantity, we term the r-value, that quantifies the extent of this reliance on single studies. We suggest adding the r-values to the main results and to the forest plots of systematic reviews.},

  abstract = {Framing effects are said to occur when equivalent frames lead to different choices. However, the equivalence in question has been incompletely conceptualized. In a new normative analysis of framing effects, we complete the conceptualization by introducing the notion of information equivalence. Information equivalence obtains when no choice-relevant inferences can be drawn from the speaker's choice of frame. We show that, to support the normative implications traditionally attributed to framing effects, frames must be equivalent in this sense. We also present new evidence for McKenzie and Nelson's (2003) reference point hypothesis, which posits a tendency to cast descriptions in terms of what has increased relative to the reference point. This leakage of information about relative state violates information equivalence, and gives rise to a normative account of the most robust finding in the attribute framing literature - the valence-consistency of preference shifts. We argue that, more generally, valenced descriptions leak information about perceived valence. Such "implicit recommendations" may generalize the reference point explanation of the valence-consistent shift. Normative and psychological implications of the information leakage framework are discussed.}

We believe that this practice removes much of the intrinsic interest in learning to do good data analysis and contributes to the myth that statistics is dry and dull. In this article, we argue that artificial data sets should be eliminated from the curriculum and that they should be replaced with real data sets. Real data supplemented by suitable background material enable students to acquire analytic skills in an authentic research context and enable instructors to demonstrate how statistical analysis is used to model real world phenomena. To facilitate the integration of real data into applied statistics curricula, we identify seven characteristics that make data sets particularly good for instructional use and present an annotated bibliography of more than 100 primary and secondary data sources.},

  abstract = {Generalizing earlier observations by Fisher and Hotelling, Tukey [1] showed that if a family of distributions admits a set of sufficient statistics, then the family obtained by truncation to a fixed set, or by a fixed selection, also admits the same set of sufficient statistics (this wording is Tukey's; we give a precise mathematical statement later). Tukey's proof assumed the relevant family of probability measures to be dominated by a fixed measure function and made use of the factorization theorem concerning sufficient statistics in this case. In the present short note we shall first re-prove Tukey's result without assuming domination (and, hence, without appealing to the factorization theorem). Then we shall show that, under general conditions, if a sufficient statistic has one or more of the properties of completeness, bounded completeness, or minimality, before truncation, then it preserves such after truncation. The treatment is on the lines of the abstract discussion of sufficient statistics given by Halmos and Savage [2]. We shall assume familiarity with the results given in this latter paper. For definitions of completeness, bounded completeness, and minimality, and for a discussion of the significance of these concepts we refer to Lehmann and Scheff{\'e} [3].},

Here, we describe an open dataset of responses from children who completed a story booklet task for assessing ToM reasoning (n = 321 3--12-year-old children, including 64 (neurotypical) children assessed longitudinally and 68 autistic children). Children completed one of two versions of the story booklet task (Booklet 1 or 2). Both versions include two-alternative forced choice and free response questions that tap ToM concepts ranging in difficulty from reasoning about desires and beliefs to reasoning about moral blameworthiness and mistaken referents. Booklet 2 additionally includes items that assess understanding of sarcasm, lies, and second-order belief-desire reasoning. Compared to other ToM tasks, the booklet task provides relatively dense sampling of ToM reasoning within each child (Booklet 1: 41 items; Booklet 2: 65 items). Experimental sessions were video recorded and data were coded offline; the open dataset consists of children's accuracy (binary) on each item and, for many children (n = 171), transcriptions of free responses. The dataset also includes children's scores on standardized tests of receptive language and non-verbal IQ, as well as other demographic information. As such, this dataset is a valuable resource for investigating the development of ToM reasoning in early and middle childhood.},

  abstract = {Publication selection bias is a serious challenge to the integrity of all empirical sciences. We derive meta-regression approximations to reduce this bias. Our approach employs Taylor polynomial approximations to the conditional mean of a truncated distribution. A quadratic approximation without a linear term, precision-effect estimate with standard error (PEESE), is shown to have the smallest bias and mean squared error in most cases and to outperform conventional meta-analysis estimators, often by a great deal. Monte Carlo simulations also demonstrate how a new hybrid estimator that conditionally combines PEESE and the Egger regression intercept can provide a practical solution to publication selection bias. PEESE is easily expanded to accommodate systematic heterogeneity along with complex and differential publication selection bias that is related to moderator variables. By providing an intuitive reason for these approximations, we can also explain why the Egger regression works so well and when it does not. These meta-regression methods are applied to several policy-relevant areas of research including antidepressant effectiveness, the value of a statistical life, the minimum wage, and nicotine replacement therapy.

  abstract = {Procrastination is a common form of self-regulatory failure with substantive connections to lower levels of health, wealth and well-being. Conducting an epidemiological study, we determined the characteristics of prototypical procrastinators from a global sample based on several relevant self-reported demographic variables. Using an internet sampling strategy, we surveyed 16 413 English-speaking adults (58.3\% women; 41.7\% men: M age = 38.3 years, SD = 14), specifically on the variables of sex, age, marital status, family size, education, community location, and national origin. Almost all the results were statistically significant because of our large sample size. However, procrastination tendencies were most prominently associated with sex, age, marital status, education and nationality. Procrastinators tended to be young, single men with less education, residing in countries with lower levels of self-discipline. Notably, procrastination mediated the relationship between sex and education, providing further support that men are lagging behind women academically because of lower self-regulatory skills. Given procrastination's connection with a variety of societal ailments (e.g. excessive debt, delayed medical treatment), identifying risk factors and at risk populations should be helpful for directing preventative public policy.

As hypothesized, we observed that endorsement of neoliberal, free market ideology was significantly but modestly associated with bullshit receptivity. In addition, we observed a quadratic association, which indicated that ideological moderates were more susceptible to bullshit than ideological extremists. These relationships were explained, in part, by heuristic processing tendencies, faith in intuition, and lower verbal ability. Results are inconsistent with approaches suggesting that (a) there are no meaningful ideological differences in cognitive style or reasoning ability, (b) simplistic, certainty-oriented cognitive styles are generally associated with leftist (vs. rightist) economic preferences, or (c) simplistic, certainty-oriented cognitive styles are generally associated with extremist (vs. moderate) preferences.

  abstract = {In this article, we analyse the evidential value of the corpus of experimental philosophy (x-phi). While experimental philosophers claim that their studies provide insight into philosophical problems, some philosophers and psychologists have expressed concerns that the findings from these studies lack evidential value. Barriers to evidential value include selection bias (i.e., the selective publication of significant results) and p-hacking (practices that increase the odds of obtaining a p-value below the significance level). To find out whether the significant findings in x-phi papers result from selection bias or p-hacking, we applied a p-curve analysis to a corpus of 365 x-phi chapters and articles. Our results suggest that this corpus has evidential value, although there are hints of p-hacking in a few parts of the x-phi corpus.},

  abstract = {With a sudden move to remote and online teaching due to COVID-19 pandemic, Organic Chemistry became more challenging for both students and educators with the emergence of new technological challenges and instructional strategies. The Organic Chemistry I class at SUNY Plattsburgh was shifted to an online learning model in an attempt to mimic face-to-face teaching as well as maintaining active learning. This communication highlights the instructor's perspectives on the challenges and insights gained for teaching Organic Chemistry I (lecture component) for the Spring 2020 semester in the time of COVID-19. A combination of asynchronous and synchronous teaching methods was found to be effective for content delivery, active learning, and increasing student's engagement. Synchronous class attendance was monitored and compared with typical face-to-face class attendance. Synchronous problem-solving exercises had an effect on student's attendance rate and learning. An exit survey indicated about 64\% of students had a preference for face-to-face teaching over online teaching of Organic Chemistry.}

Good theories are those that help facilitate this process by being hard to vary: They explain what they are supposed to explain, they are consistent with other good theories, and they are not easily adaptable to explain anything. Here we argue that, rather than a lack of distinction between exploratory and confirmatory research, an abundance of flexible theories is a better explanation for the current replicability problems of psychology. We also explain why popular methods-oriented solutions fail to address the real problem of flexibility. Instead, we propose that a greater emphasis on theory criticism by argument might improve replicability.},

  abstract = {HIV-positive adolescents who engage in unsafe sex are at heightened risk for transmitting or re-acquiring HIV. Disclosure of HIV-status to sexual partners may impact on condom use, but no study has explored the effects of (i) adolescent knowledge of one's HIV-status, (ii) knowledge of partner status and (iii) disclosure to partners, on safer sex behaviour. This study aimed to identify whether knowledge of HIV-status by HIV-positive adolescents and partners was associated with safer sex. Eight fifty eight HIV-positive adolescents (10--19 years old, 52\% female, 68.1\% vertically infected) who had ever initiated antiretroviral treatment in 41 health facilities in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, were interviewed using standardised questionnaires. Quantitative analyses used multivariate logistic regressions, controlling for confounders. Qualitative research included interviews, focus group discussions and observations with 43 HIV-positive teenagers and their healthcare workers. N = 128 (14.9\%) of the total sample had ever had sex, while N = 109 (85.1\%) of sexually active adolescents had boy/girlfriend. In total, 68.1\% of the sample knew their status, 41.5\% of those who were sexually active and in relationships knew their partner's status, and 35.5\% had disclosed to their partners. For adolescents, knowing one's status was associated with safer sex (OR = 4.355, CI 1.085--17.474, p = .038). Neither knowing their partner's status, nor disclosing one's HIV-status to a partner, were associated with safer sex. HIV-positive adolescents feared rejection, stigma and public exposure if disclosing to sexual and romantic partners. Counselling by healthcare workers for HIV-positive adolescents focused on benefits of disclosure, but did not address the fears and risks associated with disclosure. These findings challenge assumptions that disclosure is automatically protective in sexual and romantic relationships for HIV-positive adolescents, who may be ill-equipped to negotiate safer sex. There is a pressing need for effective interventions that mitigate the risks of disclosure and provide HIV-positive adolescents with skills to engage in safe sex.},

  abstract = {Such foundations have to include not assuming that we always know what in fact we never know --- the exact probability structure involved. We have to face up to bouquets of alternative challenges --- of alternative probability structures that are relevant, yet extreme. And we have to focus on bouquets of alternative procedures, most, if not all, of which are not the results of formal optimisation. To select a procedure for use on a given sort of data set most carefully, we need to assess performance over combinations of procedures and challenges, often minimaxing over challenges. Such assessment will rarely be possible without simulation, perhaps of an analogous situation. Selection of bouquets of challenges will involve experience, direct and extrapolated, as will selection of bouquets of procedures. Thus it will not be wrong for different experts of the greatest experience to choose different analyses of the same data. Moreover, the bouquets conventionally considered for any class of problem will evolve over time, thus changing preferred procedures. These are customary characteristics of other branches of engineering --- data analysis, to be practical, has to be engineering, not science. Model development, for real world description, not for inference, is a procedure of successive approximations where assumptions can be vital. Sound inference, on the other hand, demands facing alternative possibilities, as illustrated by diverse challenges.},

  abstract = {p-curves provide a useful window for peeking into the file drawer in a way that might reveal p-hacking (Simonsohn, Nelson, \& Simmons, 2014a). The properties of p-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of these simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be used as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a certain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually demonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous mathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined without simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any statistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough evaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions p-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition, we used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of publication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence the shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than 1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also suggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an article as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level. This gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of real effects even when no such effects are actually present. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {AIM: The perceived age of older adults, as measured by their facial appearance, has been shown to be a robust biomarker of aging predictive of survival, telomere length and DNA methylation, and reportedly correlates with carotid atherosclerosis and bone status. This study aimed to determine whether metrics of dementia, including general cognition, vitality, depressive state and self-supportability, have stronger correlations with perceived age than with chronological age. METHODS: This study included 124 patients who were admitted to the Department of Geriatric Medicine, The University of Tokyo Hospital, on account of being suspected of cognitive decline. The Mini-Mental State Examination, Vitality Index, Geriatric Depression Scale-15, instrumental activities of daily living and Barthel Index were carried out. Five experienced geriatricians and five experienced clinical psychologists determined the perceived age of participants based on photographs. RESULTS: The average values of the 10 raters showed excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (3, 10) = 0.941). Steiger's test revealed that perceived age showed a significantly better correlation with the Mini-Mental State Examination (female) and Vitality Index (total, female) than did chronological age, but not with Geriatric Depression Scale-15, instrumental activities of daily living or the Barthel Index. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived age was shown to be a reliable biomarker for cognitive assessment. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: 779-784.},

  abstract = {Objective: To test whether the format in which women receive probabilistic information about breast cancer and mammography affects their comprehension., Methods: A convenience sample of 180 women received pre-assembled randomized packages containing a breast health information brochure, with probabilities presented in either verbal or numeric format, and four questionnaires. Enclosed questionnaires assessed women's knowledge of breast health, socio-demographic/ clinical characteristics, comprehension of breast health information brochure and format preference., Results: Nearly two-thirds of the study participants reported a preference for the numeric format. However, the study results showed that comprehension was significantly higher among women who received probabilistic information in verbal format than those who received the information in numeric format. This higher degree of comprehension was sustained even if the verbal format was inconsistent with the respondents' format preference, and even if the respondents' educational background were relatively limited. Women's comprehension was strongly associated with the interaction between received format and their format preferences as well as their education level and their perceived benefit of early detection of breast cancer., Conclusion: The study demonstrates that comprehension of information depends on: (1) women's readiness to receive information; and (2) their education and numeracy skills in processing and interpreting probabilistic information, particularly, when presented in quantitative format. Attention must be paid to these factors when designing or communicating breast health information in order to ensure full comprehension of information, and to avoid any potential discrimination which people may face relating to their poor education or numeracy skills. Systematic investigation into the relationships among readiness, numeracy problems, and format preferences could help build effective guidelines for providing women with appropriate and comprehensible information.},

  abstract = {Because of overwhelming evidence of publication bias in psychology, techniques to correct meta-analytic estimates for such bias are greatly needed. The methodology on which the p-uniform and p-curve methods are based has great promise for providing accurate meta-analytic estimates in the presence of publication bias. However, in this article, we show that in some situations, p-curve behaves erratically, whereas p-uniform may yield implausible estimates of negative effect size. Moreover, we show that (and explain why) p-curve and p-uniform result in overestimation of effect size under moderate-to-large heterogeneity and may yield unpredictable bias when researchers employ p-hacking. We offer hands-on recommendations on applying and interpreting results of meta-analyses in general and p-uniform and p-curve in particular. Both methods as well as traditional methods are applied to a meta-analysis on the effect of weight on judgments of importance. We offer guidance for applying p-uniform or p-curve using R and a user-friendly web application for applying p-uniform.},

  abstract = {Network studies of human brain structural connectivity have identified a specific set of brain regions that are both highly connected and highly central. Recent analyses have shown that these putative hub regions are mutually and densely interconnected, forming a ``rich club'' within the human brain. Here we show that the set of pathways linking rich club regions forms a central high-cost, high-capacity backbone for global brain communication. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of two sets of 40 healthy subjects were used to map structural brain networks. The contributions to network cost and communication capacity of global cortico-cortical connections were assessed through measures of their topology and spatial embedding. Rich club connections were found to be more costly than predicted by their density alone and accounted for 40\% of the total communication cost. Furthermore, 69\% of all minimally short paths between node pairs were found to travel through the rich club and a large proportion of these communication paths consisted of ordered sequences of edges (``path motifs'') that first fed into, then traversed, and finally exited the rich club, while passing through nodes of increasing and then decreasing degree. The prevalence of short paths that follow such ordered degree sequences suggests that neural communication might take advantage of strategies for dynamic routing of information between brain regions, with an important role for a highly central rich club. Taken together, our results show that rich club connections make an important contribution to interregional signal traffic, forming a central high-cost, high-capacity backbone for global brain communication.},

I argue that, to the extent that problems occur in the presence of collinearity, they are not caused by it but rather by common mental shortcuts that researchers take when interpreting statistical models and that can also lead them astray in the absence of collinearity. Moreover, I illustrate that common strategies for dealing with collinearity only sidestep the perceived problem by biasing parameter estimates, reformulating the model in such a way that it maps onto different research questions, or both. I conclude that collinearity in itself is not a problem and that researchers should be aware of what their approaches for addressing it actually achieve.},

  abstract = {Drawing on the philosophy of psychological explanation, we suggest that psychological science, by focusing on effects, may lose sight of its primary explananda: psychological capacities. We revisit Marr's levels-of-analysis framework, which has been remarkably productive and useful for cognitive psychological explanation. We discuss ways in which Marr's framework may be extended to other areas of psychology, such as social, developmental, and evolutionary psychology, bringing new benefits to these fields. We then show how theoretical analyses can endow a theory with minimal plausibility even before contact with empirical data: We call this the theoretical cycle. Finally, we explain how our proposal may contribute to addressing critical issues in psychological science, including how to leverage effects to understand capacities better.},

  abstract = {According to the facial feedback hypothesis, people's affective responses can be influenced by their own facial expression (e.g., smiling, pouting), even when their expression did not result from their emotional experiences. For example, Strack, Martin, and Stepper (1988) instructed participants to rate the funniness of cartoons using a pen that they held in their mouth. In line with the facial feedback hypothesis, when participants held the pen with their teeth (inducing a ``smile''), they rated the cartoons as funnier than when they held the pen with their lips (inducing a ``pout''). This seminal study of the facial feedback hypothesis has not been replicated directly. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 17 independent direct replications of Study 1 from Strack et al. (1988), all of which followed the same vetted protocol. A meta-analysis of these studies examined the difference in funniness ratings between the ``smile'' and ``pout'' conditions. The original Strack et al. (1988) study reported a rating difference of 0.82 units on a 10-point Likert scale. Our meta-analysis revealed a rating difference of 0.03 units with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from -0.11 to 0.16.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis combines results from multiple studies aiming to increase power in finding their common effect. It would typically reject the null hypothesis of no effect if any one of the studies shows strong significance. The partial conjunction null hypothesis is rejected only when at least r of n component hypotheses are nonnull with r = 1 corresponding to a usual meta-analysis. Compared with meta-analysis, it can encourage replicable findings across studies. A by-product of it when applied to different r values is a confidence interval of r quantifying the proportion of nonnull studies. Benjamini and Heller (2008) provided a valid test for the partial conjunction null by ignoring the r - 1 smallest p-values and applying a valid meta-analysis p-value to the remaining n - r + 1 p-values. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions of admissible combined p-value for the partial conjunction hypothesis among monotone tests. Non-monotone tests always dominate monotone tests but are usually too unreasonable to be used in practice. Based on these findings, we propose a generalized form of Benjamini and Heller's test which allows usage of various types of meta-analysis p-values, and apply our method to an example in assessing replicable benefit of new anticoagulants across subgroups of patients for stroke prevention.},

Missing from most current practices is power analysis for detecting a target effect (e.g., a regression coefficient between latent variables). In this article, we (a) distinguish power to detect model misspecification from power to detect a target effect, (b) report the results of a simulation study on power to detect a target regression coefficient in a three-predictor latent regression model, and (c) introduce a user-friendly Shiny app, pwrSEM, for conducting power analysis for detecting target effects in structural equation models.},

One hundred thirty-nine individuals in five age groups (18--30, 50--59, 60--69, 70--79, and 80+ years) were tested twice (Time I and Time II) on seven working memory span measures (alphabet span, backward digit span, missing digit span, subtract 2 span, running item span, and sentence span for syntactically simple and complex sentences), with an interval of approximately 6 weeks between testing. There were significant effects of age on all but two of the tasks. All the measures had adequate internal consistency. Correlations between performances at Time I and Time II were significant for all the tasks, other than the missing digit span task. The magnitude of the correlations was similar across the age groups and ranged from .52 to .81. Classification of subjects into discrete memory span groups on the basis of a single measure was highly inconsistent across testing sessions and tasks. Classification into upper and lower quartiles was more stable than using a cutoff score for group membership or than classification into high-, medium-, and low-span groups. Correlational analyses showed that there was a moderate relationship between performances on many of the span tasks. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that six of the seven tasks reflected a common factor. Both test---retest reliability and stability of classification improved when a composite measure reflecting performance on several tasks was used.},

Seventy-three undergraduate STEM students from across the country completed five-point Likert-style surveys in these areas of student engagement, both prior to their science course transitioning online and at the end of the spring 2020 semester. We found that while overall behavioral engagement did not change, students participated less frequently in class discussions but met with professors more often outside of class. We saw no significant change in cognitive engagement, indicating that while students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy ideally increases over the course of the semester, in this case, it did not. Most alarmingly, we found a significant decrease in emotional engagement, with students reporting a drastic decline in positive attitudes toward science. Students' reported stress levels remained unchanged, and students reported a slight increase in their perceived value of the science course they were taking. These data shed light on how the transition to online learning had an overall negative impact on undergraduate student engagement in science courses.},

  abstract = {Social scientists often seek to demonstrate that a construct has incremental validity over and above other related constructs. However, these claims are typically supported by measurement-level models that fail to consider the effects of measurement (un)reliability. We use intuitive examples, Monte Carlo simulations, and a novel analytical framework to demonstrate that common strategies for establishing incremental construct validity using multiple regression analysis exhibit extremely high Type I error rates under parameter regimes common in many psychological domains. Counterintuitively, we find that error rates are highest---in some cases approaching 100\%---when sample sizes are large and reliability is moderate. Our findings suggest that a potentially large proportion of incremental validity claims made in the literature are spurious. We present a web application (http://jakewestfall.org/ivy/) that readers can use to explore the statistical properties of these and other incremental validity arguments. We conclude by reviewing SEM-based statistical approaches that appropriately control the Type I error rate when attempting to establish incremental validity.},

Questionable research practices have potentially undermined the evidentiary value of commonly used research paradigms in psychological science. Subsequently, the evidentiary value of these common methodologies remains uncertain. To quantify the severity of these issues in the literature, we selected the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) as a case study and submitted 170 hypothesis tests spanning over 50 years of research to a preregistered p-curve analysis. The TAP literature (N = 24,685) demonstrated significant evidentiary value but yielded a small average effect size (d = 0.29) and inadequate power (38\%). The main effects demonstrated greater evidentiary value, power, and effect sizes than interactions. Studies that tested the effects of measured traits did not differ in evidentiary value or power to those that tested the effects of experimentally manipulated states. Exploratory analyses revealed that evidentiary value, statistical power, and effect sizes have improved over time. We provide recommendations for researchers who seek to maximize the evidentiary value of their psychological measures.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses consistently find a substantial possible association between neonatal jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia) and later autism risk. The obvious question this poses is "what is the source of this risk?" This review explores the complementary roles of jaundice severity and time, racial and geographic disparities, and early infant feeding regime change, and discusses potential implications of these findings. A range of factors appears to increase the risk of autism development following neonatal jaundice, all of which are associated with the "exclusive breastfeeding" paradigm. Severity presents an intuitive risk factor in the context of bilirubin neurotoxicity; jaundice from the modal root cause of insufficient milk intake progresses as that condition persists. Racial and geographic disparities present another intuitive set of risk factors, including a heightened risk of missed diagnosis for darker-skinned neonates and delayed care access in poorer settings. In addition to these intuitive factors, near- or full-term as opposed to preterm status and phototherapy treatment may also heighten risk. These counter-intuitive findings provide additional support for deprivation/starvation as a crucial antecedent or independent variable, and time as a mediator to progression in and subsequent risk from jaundice; heightened medical monitoring and supplementation seem to protect preterms, and phototherapy risks iatrogenesis, having replaced without sufficient safety evidence the prior standard treatment of switching jaundiced, breastfed babies to formula. Critically, jaundice associated with insufficient milk intake due to breastfeeding insufficiencies is fully preventable and trivially treatable with appropriate supplemental milk. Feeding neonates adequately may play an important role in preventing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, hearing impairment, learning disorders, and mood disorders. Precautionary principle invocation is overdue.},

  abstract = {Open peer review (OPR), where review reports and reviewers' identities are published alongside the articles, represents one of the last aspects of the open science movement to be widely embraced, although its adoption has been growing since the turn of the century. This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of OPR adoption, its early adopters and the implementation approaches used. Current bibliographic databases do not systematically index OPR journals, nor do the OPR journals clearly state their policies on open identities and open reports. Using various methods, we identified 617 OPR journals that published at least one article with open identities or open reports as of 2019 and analyzed their wide-ranging implementations to derive emerging OPR practices. The findings suggest that: (1) there has been a steady growth in OPR adoption since 2001, when 38 journals initially adopted OPR, with more rapid growth since 2017; (2) OPR adoption is most prevalent in medical and scientific disciplines (79.9\%); (3) five publishers are responsible for 81\% of the identified OPR journals; (4) early adopter publishers have implemented OPR in different ways, resulting in different levels of transparency. Across the variations in OPR implementations, two important factors define the degree of transparency: open identities and open reports. Open identities may include reviewer names and affiliation as well as credentials; open reports may include timestamped review histories consisting of referee reports and author rebuttals or a letter from the editor integrating reviewers' comments. When and where open reports can be accessed are also important factors indicating the OPR transparency level. Publishers of optional OPR journals should add metric data in their annual status reports.},

Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety.

Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology's near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.},

  abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned -- that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology -- the linear mixed model -- I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the ``random effect'' formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

  abstract = {The relationship of parents' cigarette smoking to outcome of pregnancy---implications as to the problem of inferring causation from observed associations. Amer J Epidem 1971;93:443--456. Nearly 10 000 white and more than 3000 black women were interviewed early in pregnancy on a variety of medical, genetic, environmental, and behavior variables. The increase in the incidence of low-birth-weight among infants of smoking mothers was confirmed. However, a number of paradoxical findings were observed which raise doubts as to causation. Thus, no increase in neonatal mortality was noted. Rather, the neonatal mortality rate and the risk of congenital anomalies of low-birthweight infants were considerably lower for smoking than for nonsmoking mothers. These favorable results cannot be explained by differences in gestational age, nor does a ``displacement'' hypothesis appear reasonable. Among other findings which could not easily be explained: The healthiest low-birth-weight infants were found for couples where the wife smoked and her husband did not smoke; the most vulnerable were produced by couples where the wife did not smoke and the husband smoked. There were great differences in mode-of-life characteristics between smokers and nonsmokers. The latter were more likely to use contraceptive methods, to plan the baby, less likely to drink coffee and hard liquor, and in general appeared to live at a much slower and moderate pace than the smokers. Most puzzling difference is that of age at menarche, which was lower for smoking mothers. These paradoxical findings raise doubts and argue against the proposition that cigarette smoking acts as an exogenous factor which interferes with intrauterine development of the fetus.},

It has been studied from many different theoretical angles, and a variety of causes and consequences have been suggested. Recent studies support the notion that academic procrastination can be seen from a situational perspective and as a failure in learning self-regulation. It suggests that interventions should address situational as well as deficits in self-regulation to help students overcome their procrastinating tendencies. The present review examined the recent literature on causes and consequences of academic procrastination and the limited number of studies of academic interventions for academic procrastination. Findings of this review strengthen the need to further study the topic of academic interventions for academic procrastination and to develop effective interventions. At the end of this review, several suggestions for the development of academic interventions are outlined.},

  abstract = {The inverse normal and Fisher's methods are two common approaches for combining P-values. Whitlock demonstrated that a weighted version of the inverse normal method, or 'weighted Z-test', is superior to Fisher's method for combining P-values for one-sided T-tests. The problem with Fisher's method is that it does not take advantage of weighting and loses power to the weighted Z-test when studies are differently sized. This issue was recently revisited by Chen, who observed that Lancaster's variation of Fisher's method had higher power than the weighted Z-test. Nevertheless, the weighted Z-test has comparable power to Lancaster's method when its weights are set to square roots of sample sizes. Power can be further improved when additional information is available. Although there is no single approach that is the best in every situation, the weighted Z-test enjoys certain properties that make it an appealing choice as a combination method for meta-analysis.},
