The $P$-curve (Simonsohn, Nelson, & Simmons, 2014; Simonsohn, Simmons, & Nelson, 2015) is a widely-used suite of meta-analytic tests advertised for detecting problems in sets of studies. They are based on nonparametric combinations of $p$ values (e.g., Marden, 1985) across significant ($p$<.05) studies and are variously claimed to detect "evidential value", "lack of evidential value", and "left skew" in $p$ values. We show that these tests do not have the properties ascribed to them. Moreover, they fail basic desiderata for tests, including admissibility and monotonicity. In light of these serious problems, we recommend against the use of the $P$-curve tests.
